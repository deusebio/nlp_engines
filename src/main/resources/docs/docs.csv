0;"Bitcoin price has crossed; the $270 mark, which is really good news for bitcoin after it fell drastically from the $300 pedestal in July. The prices have touched $270 a couple of times since then. From the past few days, the bitcoin price has seen a positive trend. The trend seems to be influenced by a lot of reasons. But the most important reason for prices to shoot further up from previous price point seems to be influenced by reports pointing towards a global economic slowdown.Bitcoin price received an initial boost after the main Chinese exchanges Huobi and OKCoin experienced a surge in bitcoin trading. Increased trading among the Chinese maybe influenced by the Chinese economy experiencing a slowdown, which was confirmed recently by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang in a speech while addressing heads of various provinces. His statement has led to speculation about further devaluation of Chinese Yuan, influencing people to invest in alternative assets like bitcoin.On the other front, the United States doesn’t have any good news either. Confidence in the US economy seems to be waning away among the general public. A recent poll by CNNMoney and E*Trade reported people judging their country’s economy to be mediocre at best. The survey report is compounded further by the government reporting a fall in the consumer price index and producer price index. Most of these are attributed to weak petroleum prices. These reports followed by the weakening US Dollar seems to have contributed to the rising bitcoin price trend which we are noticing today";Bitcoin/blockchain;http://www.newsbtc.com/2015/10/17/bitcoin-price-surges-past-270-influenced-by-global-economy/
1;Bitcoin exchange company Bitreserve, Inc. has changed its name to Uphold, Inc. as part of a repositioning of the company that sees it integrate with the global financial ecosystem in ways that are rare for Bitcoin exchanges.The biggest change sees Uphold (previously Bitreserve) allow consumers, businesses and charities to fund their Uphold accounts via bank transfer or by linking a credit or debit card, in addition to the original Bitcoin offering.Support for bank transfers and credit cards will be available as of today in 33 European countries. In the coming weeks the same service will also be available in the United States, China and India.In another first, the company plans to roll out in December both physical and virtual payment cards with Visa, MasterCard and Discover Card that will allow users to pay merchants online or in-store, directly from their Uphold accounts.If it’s not immediately obvious, so far the biggest change with Uphold is that that it is no longer a Bitcoin-only service, and although they are continuing to offer Bitcoin services they are now facilitating payments, nearly PayPal-like, between bank accounts, debit and credit cards, in addition to cryptocurrencies.The pitch is all about cost, with Uphold allowing members to move, convert, hold and transact in any form of fiat currency or cryptocurrency instantly, securely, and mostly for free with the exception that a charge of 2.75 percent applies if members choose to fund their account with a debit or credit card.“Our mission is to make it easy and frictionless for anyone, anywhere to move, convert, hold and transact in any form of money or commodity securely, instantly and for free,” Uphold President and Chief Executive Officer Anthony Watson said in an email sent to SiliconANGLE. “By connecting the world’s legacy and fragmented financial networks and systems with the world’s leading cloud-money platform we bring to the marketplace instant,  transparent, accountable and free financial services for all.”;Bitcoin/blockchain;http://siliconangle.com/blog/2015/10/14/bitcoin-exchange-bitreserve-rebrands-as-uphold-and-now-offers-fiat-money-services/
2;"Being one of the largest continents in the world, Asia is a metropolitan center booming with economic and financial success. And when it comes to the future of cryptocurrency, Asian markets – which harbor half of the global population, most of them highly tech-friendly – are a gold mine.  Bitcoin also offers the possibility of being used as a currency in Asia because, at the moment, there aren’t a lot of good payment and withdrawal methods that cater to cryptocurrency. Therefore, as an acknowledgment of the modernization taking over the Asian continent, Bitcoin can be used as a medium of exchange for goods and services.According to Mildred Ang, of Terrapinn Pte Ltd:“We have seen a growing number of innovative technologies that are disrupting the traditional means. It will be interesting to observe the future direction of bitcoins in Asia; the markets which are most receptive, and the different uses for bitcoins and the statistics of adoption rates.”In other words, digital currency has a great future in Asia, as people are becoming more open-minded and accepting. With the barter system behind us, Bitcoin has the immense possibility of revolutionizing Asia’s cyber commerce industry.This especially holds true as we see how Bitcoin trends are finding firm roots in Asian countries.Chinachina-flag1Known for its growing manufacturing industry, China is required to move money across continents quite regularly. Therefore, Bitcoin can be used as a means to avoid government regulations and help aid an efficient and safe movement of capital from one place to the other.As a consequence, the major Chinese banks do not embrace this practice or cryptocurrency with open arms and are now feeling threatened by Bitcoin’s ability to cut out the middle man. Therefore, many of the country’s Bitcoin exchanges cannot afford to accept Chinese Yuan.However, Bitcoin can still be traded as an investment in China, as the country is home to about 20 Bitcoin companies of notable size with about 800,000 total users, constituting about 70 percent of the global Bitcoin trading volume.Also, China has a strong competitive advantage in Bitcoin mining; BTC/CNY is one of the most traded currency pairs, which is why the country accounts for at least 50 percent of the global Bitcoin network mining power.VietnamVBTC, Vietnam’s largest Bitcoin exchange, is relaunching on BlinkTrade’s Bitcoin exchange platform with their goals centered on Vietnam’s $14 billion remittance market. The trade promises one-hour international payments to Vietnam with cash withdrawals available at hundreds of places nationwide.In fact, according to Bitcoin Vietnam co-founder Dominik Weil:“VBTC will allow us to handle Bitcoin remittance services towards Vietnam in a very fast and price-competitive way. In an ideal setup it will take you less than one hour to send funds to your beloved ones in Vietnam – from sending the Bitcoins to us until the recipient in Vietnam holds the cash in his hands.”“This is already possible today,” Weil adds in a press release. This holds true as we look at ‘Future.Travel’ – a Ho Chi Minh City-based travel agency providing services such as flight tickets, cruises, tours and hotel accommodations, becoming the first business in Vietnam to accept Bitcoin payments. Users are now able to pay for flight tickets using Bitcoin on the website, while other services will be handled via offline mode.PhilippinesLocated south of Taiwan, this island country is ranked first in average time spent online and third for incoming migrant remittances. A few months ago, the Manila Bulletin – a top-five newspaper in the Philippines – published a very optimistic Bitcoin article on the cover of their business section. After the publication, the level of trade on Local Bitcoins in Manila reached unexpected heights. The subject of the featured article was a local Bitcoin company called Paylance.Another similar company is Coins.ph, which was launched in 2014. By using Bitcoin, it offers several services including ways to transfer cash, pay bills and easily top up users’ cell phones. They boast the largest number of retail locations for Filipinos, mainly due to the partnerships with some of the country’s largest banks and e-commerce platform.Also, it is important to note that Bitcoins have immense potential in this country because most Filipinos do not have bank accounts and, therefore, are that much freer to use cryptocurrency.IndonesiaAt the moment – making up about one percent of the total Bitcoin usage worldwide -, Indonesia has allegedly shown some interest in virtual currencies. Even though Bitcoin is not regulated by the country’s central bank, and while there are concerns surrounding the effects that cryptocurrency might have, many websites in the country are already accepting Bitcoin as a method of payment.Being one of the most populated parts of the world, the give and take of money in Asia can be revolutionized by replacing legal tender with digital currencies. If not fully, at least the revolution can be partial. Furthermore, most Asian countries are still developing, and hence they don’t have existing established capital empires. In other words, there is a lot of potential for innovations like Bitcoin to dominate the local financial nuances.Also, those same countries also have businesses that depend on foreign interests. This means money transfer and remittance are a huge opportunity, as well as a problem, which Bitcoin has the ability to solve and smooth out.However, in order to get the most benefit out of cryptocurrency, and thereby secure the future of Bitcoin in Asian markets, governments need to see the potential that digital currencies yield and provide them with the right environment to develop.Only then will Bitcoin entrepreneurs feel confident enough to create and find new ways for Bitcoin and the blockchain to be incorporated in the budding economy of Asia, which is a necessary step for the creation of a bright, long-lasting future for Bitcoin on one of the most diverse continents on the planet.";Bitcoin/blockchain;https://99bitcoins.com/digital-innovation-in-asia-bitcoins-booming-future/
3;"Earlier this year, Overstock.com CEO Patrick Byrne bought a $500,000 bond issued by the online retailer.But it wasn’t the size of the bond that drew attention. It was the way it was sold: through Overstock’s new digital trading platform T0, which records securities trades through the same shared ledger technology that backs cryptographic currencies like bitcoin.Advocates of the digital ledger technology, known as the blockchain, say its use in traditional financial transactions could prove far more revolutionary than the alternative currencies for which it was first created.“The main event isn’t bitcoin. It’s using the blockchain to disrupt other industries and Wall Street. ”Storing transactions in one automatically shared, tamper-proof database could eliminate the need for complicated procedures and clearinghouses now used to make sure banks have their records in sync, saving time and money and reducing the risk of error.And that has startups and established companies lining up to design the trading platforms, programming tools, and other infrastructure that’ll soon be needed if blockchain-based finance goes mainstream.""The main event isn’t bitcoin,"" says Byrne. ""It’s using the blockchain to disrupt other industries and Wall Street.""T0 takes its name from its ability to finalize transactions essentially instantaneously. Traditional stock and bond sales take three business days—or T+3 in industry jargon —to fully settle, before the assets are available in the buyer’s account and the purchase value is available to the seller.Those traditional transfers are generally logged by an industry body called the Depository Trust Company, created in the 1970s to track the ownership of securities. But with blockchain-based securities, records are automatically shared between all of the participants in the market in close to real time, so the transaction’s effectively settled as soon as it’s recorded to that collective ledger, without the need for an intermediary like the DTC.""What blockchains do is allow for a transaction to occur between financial institutions or people but without the need of that intermediary, because you can reliably send the assets to each other very quickly and in basically near real time and without any chance of having that transaction be reversed or changed,"" says Peter Shiau, the cofounder and CEO of financial blockchain startup Blockstack.io.The blockchain concept was first developed by bitcoin’s pseudonymous (and mysterious) creator Satoshi Nakamoto as a way to track ownership of the digital currency. When bitcoin owners spend or transfer the currency, their digital wallet software publishes a cryptographically signed record of the transaction to the global network of bitcoin users.Bitcoin miners are then rewarded with new bitcoin for bundling those individual records into groups called blocks and recording them to a permanent shared ledger called the blockchain. Only blocks satisfying certain mathematical properties in relation to the previous block on the chain are considered valid, making it effectively impossible to tamper with records of previous transactions.But while blockchains were first created to track bitcoin, experts say there’s no reason why they can’t be used to track other types of assets, from securities to event tickets to old-fashioned U.S. currency.""A blockchain’s just a ledger—it just tells you who has what and that someone sent something to somebody else,"" says Shiau. ""The ability to know with certainty that something happened is what’s critical.""Overstock transferred the bond bought by Byrne, as well with a second ""proof-of-concept"" bond bought by financial firm First New York for $5 million, by recording the transaction to the actual public bitcoin blockchain, using a standard called Open Assets designed to record any kind of transfer to that shared ledger.And other companies, such as Blockstack, are developing technology to let financial institutions create their own private blockchains, changing features from bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to better suit their own purposes.""If you take the software and install it in a private context, you can do whatever you want,"" says Shiau.Banks might wish to adjust the size limits of transaction blocks, or the speed at which they’re added to the network, security features, or other settings, or keep their blockchains only accessible to their trading partners over a secure network. They may also incorporate support for so-called smart contracts—essentially simple programs embedded within the blockchain that define rules for when assets get transferred, allowing procedures such as dividend and interest payments and escrow arrangements to be automated with logic stored in the same shared database as the assets themselves.Some experts say the actual requirements banks have could be satisfied by data structures other than blockchains—once banks control who has access to a shared ledger, they could really rely on pre-bitcoin technology to achieve the same goals, argued Arvind Narayanan, an assistant professor of computer science at Princeton University, in a recent blog post.Indeed, banks might be better off in many cases just sticking with traditional database technology, says Paul Chou, the CEO of LedgerX, a startup building trading infrastructure for bitcoin derivatives.""If you restrict access to trusted parties, then an intelligently managed shared database is a fast and proven solution—there is no need for a blockchain,"" he wrote in an email to Fast Company.And if banks find they won't benefit enough in terms of efficiency from blockchain-based systems, switching likely won't be worth the risk, he argues.""Imagine how terrifying it is to design a whole new system from scratch with a datastore that has only been around for a few years,"" he wrote. ""Only if banks find a technology that can improve things by an order of magnitude, say 10 times more efficient, will it make sense to totally abandon a slow, but proven platform to gain those efficiencies.Still, Princeton's Narayanan wrote in his blog post, the excitement around bitcoin and the math that makes it work may have motivated banks to start thinking more seriously about updating some aging technology and processes.""In my view, it’s not the novelty of blockchain technology but rather its mindshare that has gotten Wall Street to converge on it, driven by the fear of missing out,"" wrote Narayanan. ""It’s acted as a focal point for standardization.""And banks may end up relying on different blockchains for different purposes, says Makoto Takemiya, the chief blockchain officer at Japanese startup Mijin, which plans next year to begin beta testing its private blockchain technology with industry partners and release open source code.""I think there’s going to be room for multiple blockchains that institutions can have,"" he says.One London-based startup, called Everledger, is developing blockchain tools for the diamond industry, designed to log information on ethical sourcing, insurance claims, and theft investigations, associated with detailed digital descriptions of the valuable stones. Private information on police investigations or private transactions will be stored on a private blockchain, and information like diamonds’ conflict-free certification will be logged to the public bitcoin blockchain, says CEO Leanne Kemp.""You would be able to identify whether those diamonds are truly certified or not certified,"" she says.Everledger participated earlier this year in an accelerator program backed by Barclays, the giant U.K.-based bank, as large financial institutions around the world are beginning to seriously investigate the benefits of blockchain technology.Financial technology firm R3 announced last month that it’s working with 22 major financial institutions, including Barclays, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, to develop and test software and standards the banks can use to build blockchain-based services. The firms have looked at a number of potential use cases—from issuing and settling the transfer of securities to transferring the rights to loans—but they’re focusing first on devising lower-level protocols on which those services can be built, says R3 CEO David Rutter.""We kind of think setting the foundation first is the right thing before we start worrying about the wallpaper in the bedroom,"" says Rutter.R3 aims to develop, and potentially make open source, basic blockchain protocols analogous to telephone or Internet networking standards upon which financial services tools can be built. And, Rutter says, they’re working closely with the banks to make sure those firms’ needs are met.""Let’s pause the mad rush for a second, and make sure that we have the basic requirements that are needed to build this technology, especially if we think that it’s going to be a solution that’s going to provide benefits for the next 10, 20 or 30 years,"" he says.That’s not an unrealistic requirement, when the current system of securities settlement, revolving around the DTC, dates back to 1970s reforms led by Congress and the Securities and Exchange Commission. It, too, evolved from a push for efficiency, after increased transaction volume proved too much for the paper-based stock certificate system it replaced: A Wall Street ""paperwork crisis"" had led to increasing numbers of errors, canceled trades, and millions of dollars in hard-to-catch fraud.Rutter says it’s still too early for the company to have had detailed discussions with regulators like the SEC, though he says a move toward blockchain could make their lives easier as well, since it’ll be easier to analyze transactions recorded in one shared ledger rather than looking at disparate databases across multiple financial firms.""You can build software that would allow regulators to peek at that data in a way that would make sense for them in a more timely fashion and with absolute confidence that what they’re looking at is a clean picture,"" he says.As far as Overstock, which has said it plans to offer blockchain-recorded securities to a wider audience, Byrne says the company’s had productive talks with the agency so far.""I think,"" he says, ""that they’re gonna let the crypto-revolution occur.""";Bitcoin/blockchain;
4;The bitcoin industry is still years away from maturity. Unfortunately, many business were launched on the back of overly optimistic industry growth projections. The hard reality is, there just isn’t currently enough volume to support all the exchanges, payment gateways and wallet providers that have sprung up, let alone the number of secondary service providers, such as bitcoin compliance solutions, that have been created to support the first wave of service providers.Belt tighteningMany of these businesses will need to take radical steps to survive the next few years while consumer adoption catches up with service provider expectation. We are already seeing signs of this where those business that haven’t been able to reach critical mass are forced to close, resize, pivot or merge with competitors.Expect to see this trend accelerate in the next 12-18 months. Even those companies that have raised large amounts of investment aren’t immune to the situation. Indeed, they will now have a different type of pressure to deal with – the pressure of investor expectation and the fight to avoid the dreaded ‘down round’ if they need to secure further funds to continue operating, which many will.Bitcoin businesses will need to learn very quickly that they have to grow with the industry rather than ahead of it. Consumer education and the public promotion of bitcoin is admirable, not to mention required, but we are still several years away from sports sponsorship being an optimal use of company funds.Well-backed business with patient investors or those that are owner-operated with a low cost base will be best placed to survive.Blockchain needs bitcoin (or at least its user base)A lot of investors are now chasing so-called ‘blockchain ideas’. However, it’s not always entirely clear how a lot of these ideas will generate revenue or gain user traction any time soon. A sensible approach would be for blockchain businesses that are targeting consumers to partner with more established bitcoin business that are already operating in the space and have reached a critical mass of users.At least then they would have ready access to a consumer base that has some appetite for more nascent blockchain-related services. It’s hard to imagine people who haven’t already experimented with bitcoin, suddenly rushing to register assets on the blockchain, for example.Surely it’s those people that have adopted and experimented with bitcoin that will be the most likely early adopters of blockchain services as well. For many, bitcoin will become the gateway to the blockchain. It’s how people will get comfortable with the technology.bitcoin ownershipBitcoin is the gateway to blockchain technology.The banking issueIt has been said many times that bitcoin needs a killer app to become mainstream. However, don’t we have that already in the form of extremely cheap peer-to-peer payments? What is needed is a more seamless consumer experience between traditional finance and bitcoin.Bitcoin is currently functioning in spite of an awkward relationship with banks. If this relationship could be improved then bitcoin could thrive. How can we ever hope to get greater consumer adoption for bitcoin when many users’ first experience is the loss of £25 for an international bank transfer or a 3% credit card fee for the pleasure of acquiring their first bitcoin. It’s self-defeating and means only diehards and those keen on experimentation will make the leap from fiat to crypto currency.So, how do we bridge the gap between banking and bitcoin? Unsurprisingly, the answer lies in banking’s favourite arena of regulation and compliance.RegulationRegulation is required to give banks the certainty they need to provide banking facilities to the sector. How a bitcoin business then satisfies a bank that they are in compliance with any relevant regulation is the next big hurdle. This is where regulators need to realise that applying traditional compliance metrics to bitcoin is pointless.A new paradigm is needed that recognises and embraces the unique characteristics of bitcoin. As a result, bitcoin compliance and those who create products that are able to help get banks comfortable with bitcoin, is critical to the development and growth of the sector. Herein lies the acid test, if the bitcoin compliance providers can’t create a product that banks approve of, they won’t get many clients.It will be interesting if the Isle of Man’s new Designated Business Act, which comes into force in the next few weeks and requires crypto businesses to register with the island’s financial regulator, does anything to enhance bank’s appetite for the sector.Ten predictions for 20161.Bitcoin companies with just one business line will increasingly become disintermediated by those that offer multiple services.2.Investor clamour for all things blockchain will return full circle as blockchain start-ups begin to partner with more established bitcoin businesses.3.Sadly more bitcoin business will close or consolidate.4.Bitcoin adoption will continue to move slowly forward – mass consumer adoption is still in the future.5.The relationships between banks and bitcoin business will begin to thaw as more sophisticated bitcoin compliance solutions come to the market.6.We will see fewer and fewer pure bitcoin start-ups – those that already exist now have too much of a head start.7.Bitcoin legislation will begin to evolve at a faster pace and will help give the sector added credibility.8.There will be more fraud related to altcoins.9.Investment in the sector will plateau until consumer adoption dramatically increases.10.The price of bitcoin will remain relatively static around the $200-$300 range.Final thoughtUltimately, bitcoin will survive and gain greater public adoption – the technology is simply to compelling to ignore. However, whether many of the companies currently operating in the space will survive long enough to reach the promised land remains to be seen.Lean business models and frugality are the order of the day for bitcoin companies in 2016. A loyal and growing customer base will surely help as well.;Bitcoin/blockchain;http://www.coindesk.com/what-2016-holds-for-bitcoin-businesses/
5;"The highly-anticipated 21 Bitcoin computer, which has the bitcoin protocol as part of its operating system, has been touted as a long-hoped-for solution to enabling micro transactions over the Internet. But one technology observer has voiced doubts about this based on the amount of power the device will require.Timothy B. Lee, a senior editor at Vox Media, wrote an extensive article why the 21 Bitcoin computer will not become the solution for micropayments. He claims the computer will consume too much electricity to be profitable for users, will be hackable, and will need to be replaced every few years.The company behind the 21 Bitcoin Computer, 21 Inc., has raised $120 million from investors including Paypal co-founder Peter Thiel and Andreessen Horowitz.A Solution For Micro Payments?21 Inc.’s backers believe that the ability to generate small quantities of bitcoins will become a standard component in digital devices, similar to a WiFi-chip today. They further envision a future where digital currency serves a variety of electronic transactions not possible with today's computers. This could provide a feasible system for paying for content and online services with micropayments. An example would be the ability to power a jukebox that plays ad-free music, or a camera that automatically rents its own online storage.21 Inc. believes the ability to generate a few pennies per day worth of bitcoins will open up new types of markets that don't currently exist. The existing proof of concept for the device that 21 Inc. is currently selling is aimed at developers who will create applications that use the 21 chip's capabilities. Over the next few years, 21 Inc. expects the chip will get smaller and less expensive, to the point where it can be built into various third-party devices. An example would be a small speaker that acts as an ad-free jukebox system. You plug it in, select a song, and the device starts playing. The jukebox then generates a fraction of a penny for each song played and sends it to the relevant copyright owner.The technology brings an immediate application for enabling micropayments.The existing overhead of credit card networks causes transaction fees to account for a higher portion of a transaction the smaller the transaction. Below a dollar, the economics of credit card payments don't work well.21 Bitcoin Makes a Big Bet“Technologists have been dreaming of building practical micropayments for a very long time,” Lee wrote.“There have been a number of attempts to build micropayment systems, and so far, none of these systems have really taken off. The investors behind 21 are making a big bet that Bitcoin is the technology that will finally make the concept work.”But in practice, there would be serious difficulties, Lee wrote. If there are a dozen devices in a house with the 21 Bitcoin mining chips in them, the electric bill could become suddenly higher than expected.“Maybe it was just a hot month and your air conditioning was running on overtime. Maybe some of your 21-based devices got hacked, and bad guys are stealing your electricity to generate bitcoins for themselves. Maybe your teenage son recently bought a new off-brand device that generates a lot more bitcoins (and wastes a lot more power) than it promised on the box — and sends the extra cash back to its sketchy manufacturer.”Also read: 21 Inc. Unveils A New $400 Bitcoin ComputerUnforeseen Problems Are Waiting To HappenHomeowners will have a hard time determining which appliances are responsible for the higher bills since the electric bill will not itemize each device in the home. “You'd be forced to start measuring the power consumption of the devices around your house — exactly the kind of accounting hassle 21's technology was supposed to eliminate,” Lee noted.Once a few devices get hacked or a few manufacturers start overcharging customers, customers will steer clear of these devices.Another problem Lee noted is the fact that bitcoin mining hardware becomes obsolete quickly. As new, more efficient chips are introduced, the older chips will generate fewer bitcoins.Over time, the electricity needed to power a 21 Bitcoin device could increase while the amount of bitcoins generated decreases. This, Lee noted, could require users to replace their devices with more expensive ones.“Of course, a device that only works for a couple of years could still be useful,” Lee wrote. “But in that case, it might be more efficient to just load it with pre-generated bitcoins — or even better, just have the manufacturer provide the necessary services for free and charge an extra $10 or $20 for the device. Customers like clear and transparent pricing; effectively billing costs to your electricity bill is just the opposite.”";Bitcoin/blockchain;https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/21-bitcoin-computer-wont-future-micro-payments/
6;Since it first came to prominence over 6 years ago, many questions have risen regarding the validity and safety behind bitcoin. Many are also wondering if it truly has a place in contemporary society. Will bitcoin be a long-lasting trend, or will it die out? Can it survive the ups-and-downs, or will its popularity fade away?There is evidence circulating to suggest that the coin may be at risk of ceasing to exist, but that the technology behind it may become as revolutionary as the Internet itself. Through a recent survey, the World Economic Forum has labeled the blockchain as one of the largest and most influential trends currently shaping our digital world. Banks and businesses also continue to experiment with blockchain technology on a regular basis. “Permissioned blockchains” have been introduced to banks in Japan. The general consensus behind them is that they will increase security while reducing costs and normalizing infrastructure. Furthermore, a number of high-profile companies such as computer giant IBM claim that the blockchain is the undeniable doorway into the future.But what can we say about the coin itself? Well, we know that the price, while presently stable, can change at any minute (and it usually does). This has often led to feelings of distrust and worry amongst users and the general public. Furthermore, companies like BitPay are believed to be cutting their staff in order to save on costs and keep up with bitcoin’s current pace. Considering bitcoin has remained relatively stagnant over the past few months, it wouldn’t be surprising to find out that the pace has gotten “slower.”And while criminal activity regarding bitcoin has “evened out,” many look at such activity the way surfers look at a shark… It’s out there, and you never know when it could strike.;Bitcoin/blockchain;http://www.newsbtc.com/2015/09/27/the-possible-futures-of-bitcoin-and-the-blockchain/
7;"When the digital currency Bitcoin came to life in January 2009, it was noticed by almost no one apart from the handful of programmers who followed cryptography discussion groups. Its origins were shadowy: it had been conceived the previous year by a still-mysterious person or group known only by the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. And its purpose seemed quixotic: Bitcoin was to be a 'cryptocurrency', in which strong encryption algorithms were exploited in a new way to secure transactions. Users' identities would be shielded by pseudonyms. Records would be completely decentralized. And no one would be in charge—not governments, not banks, not even Nakamoto.Yet the idea caught on. Today, there are some 14.6 million Bitcoin units in circulation. Called bitcoins with a lowercase 'b', they have a collective market value of around US$3.4 billion. Some of this growth is attributable to criminals taking advantage of the anonymity for drug trafficking and worse. But the system is also drawing interest from financial institutions such as JP Morgan Chase, which think it could streamline their internal payment processing and cut international transaction costs. It has inspired the creation of some 700 other cryptocurrencies. And on 15 September, Bitcoin officially came of age in academia with the launch of Ledger, the first journal dedicated to cryptocurrency research.What fascinates academics and entrepreneurs alike is the innovation at Bitcoin's core. Known as the block chain, it serves as the official online ledger of every Bitcoin transaction, dating back to the beginning. It is also the data structure that allows those records to be updated with minimal risk of hacking or tampering—even though the block chain is copied across the entire network of computers running Bitcoin software, and the owners of those computers do not necessarily know or trust one another.Many people see this block-chain architecture as the template for a host of other applications, including self-enforcing contracts and secure systems for online voting and crowdfunding. This is the goal of Ethereum, a block-chain-based system launched in July by the non-profit Ethereum Foundation, based in Baar, Switzerland. And it is the research agenda of the Initiative for CryptoCurrencies and Contracts (IC3), an academic consortium also launched in July, and led by Cornell University in Ithaca, New York.Nicolas Courtois, a cryptographer at University College London, says that the Bitcoin block chain could be “the most important invention of the twenty-first century”—if only Bitcoin were not constantly shooting itself in the foot.Several shortcomings have become apparent in Bitcoin's implementation of the block-chain idea. Security, for example, is far from perfect: there have been more than 40 known thefts and seizures of bitcoins, several incurring losses of more than $1 million apiece.Cryptocurrency firms and researchers are attacking the problem with tools such as game theory and advanced cryptographic methods. “Cryptocurrencies are unlike many other systems, in that extremely subtle mathematical bugs can have catastrophic consequences,” says Ari Juels, co-director of IC3. “And I think when weaknesses surface there will be a need to appeal to the academic community where the relevant expertise resides.”Academic interest in cryptocurrencies and their predecessors goes back at least two decades, with much of the early work spearheaded by cryptographer David Chaum. While working at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, Chaum wanted to give buyers privacy and safety. So in 1990 he founded one of the earliest digital currencies, DigiCash, which offered users anonymity through cryptographic protocols of his own devising.DigiCash went bankrupt in 1998—partly because it had a centralized organization akin to a traditional bank, yet never managed to fit in with the financial industry and its regulations. But aspects of its philosophy re-emerged ten years later in Nakamoto's design for Bitcoin. That design also incorporated crowdsourcing and peer-to-peer networking—both of which help to avoid centralized control. Anyone is welcome to participate: it is just a matter of going online and running the open-source Bitcoin software. Users' computers form a network in which each machine is home to one constantly updated copy of the block chain.Nakamoto's central challenge with this wide-open system was the need to make sure that no one could find a way to rewrite the ledger and spend the same bitcoins twice—in effect, stealing bitcoins. His solution was to turn the addition of new transactions to the ledger into a competition: an activity that has come to be known as mining (see 'The Bitcoin game').Mining starts with incoming Bitcoin transactions, which are continuously broadcast to every computer on the network. These are collected by 'miners'—the groups or individuals who choose to participate—who start competing for the right to bundle transactions into a new block. The winner is the first to broadcast a 'proof of work'—a solution showing that he or she has solved an otherwise meaningless mathematical puzzle that involves encrypted data from the previous block, and lots of computerized trial and error. The winning block is broadcast through the Bitcoin network and added to the block chain, with the proof of work providing an all but unbreakable link. The block chain is currently almost 400,000 blocks long.In principle, this competition keeps the block chain secure because the puzzle is too hard for any one miner to solve every time. This means that no one will ever gain access to the encrypted links in the block chain and the ability to rewrite the ledger.Mining is also a way to steadily increase the bitcoin supply: the miner who wins each block gets a reward, currently 25 new bitcoins. That is worth almost $6,000 at today's prices. Nakamoto's design controls the supply increase by automatically adjusting the difficulty of the puzzle so that a new block is added roughly every ten minutes. In addition, the reward for creating a block decreases by half roughly every four years. The goal is to limit the supply to a maximum of 21 million bitcoins.The network cannot determine the value of bitcoins relative to standard currencies, or real-world goods and services. That has been left to market forces, with people trading bitcoins on online exchanges. One result is that the market price has gyrated spectacularly—especially in 2013, when the asking price soared from $13 per bitcoin in January to around $1,200 in December. That would have made the first real-world products ever paid for with the cryptocurrency—a pair of Papa John's pizzas, purchased for 10,000 bitcoins on 22 May 2010—worth almost $12 million.Puzzle solutions It did not take long for the problems with Bitcoin to become apparent. For example, because users are allowed to mask their identity with pseudonyms, the currency is perfect for screening criminal activity. That was behind the success of the online black market Silk Road, which the FBI shut down in 2013; its founder was sentenced to life in prison in May this year. But Bitcoin also had a key role in funding the whistle-blowing website WikiLeaks—an outcome that some would call beneficial. It is difficult for society to work out a legal framework to differentiate between good and bad uses of this technology, says Arvind Narayanan, a computer scientist at Princeton University in New Jersey. “How do you regulate around Bitcoin without banning the technology itself?” he asks.Other issues surfaced with Bitcoin's mining procedure. As the currency has gained value, for example, mining competition has become fiercer, with increasingly specialized computers solving the puzzles ever faster. Courtois, who has found ways to streamline the puzzle-solving process, says that at one point he was successfully earning $200 a day through mining. The rivalry has driven the establishment of large Bitcoin-mining centres in Iceland, where cooling for the computers is cheap. According to one estimate from 2014, Bitcoin miners collectively consumed as much power as the whole of Ireland.Working together Intensified Bitcoin mining has also led individual miners to pool their computational resources. Last year, the largest mining pool, GHash.IO, briefly exceeded 50% of total Bitcoin mining power—which is problematic because anyone who controls more than half of the mining power could start beating everyone else in the race to add blocks. This would effectively give them control of the transaction ledger and allow them to spend the same bitcoins over and over again. This is not just a theoretical possibility. Successful '51% attacks'—efforts to dominate mining power—have already been mounted against smaller cryptocurrencies such as Terracoin and Coiledcoin; the latter was so badly damaged that it ceased operation.To reduce the threat from mining pools, some existing cryptocurrencies, such as Litecoin, use puzzles that call more on computer memory than on processing power—a shift that tends to make it more costly to build the kind of specialized computers that the pools favour. Another approach, developed by IC3 co-director Elaine Shi and her collaborators, enlists a helpful kind of theft. “We are cryptographically ensuring that pool members can always steal the reward for themselves without being detected,” explains Shi. Their supposition is that miners would not trust each other enough to form into pools if their fellow pool members could easily waltz off with the rewards without sharing. They have built a prototype of the algorithm, and are hoping to see it tested in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.Another problem is the profligate amount of electricity used in Bitcoin mining. To reduce wastage, researchers including Shi and Juels have proposed a currency called Permacoin. Its proof of work would require miners to create a distributed archive for valuable data such as medical records, or the output of a gene-sequencing centre. This would not save energy, but would at least put it to better use.The security of cryptocurrencies is another huge concern. The many thefts of bitcoins do not result from the block-chain structure, says Narayanan, but from Bitcoin's use of standard digital-signature technology. In digital signatures, he explains, people have two numeric keys: a public one that they give to others as an address to send money to, and a private one that they use to approve transactions. But the security of that private key is only as good as the security of the machine that stores it, he says. “If somebody hacks your computer, for example, and steals your private keys, then essentially all of your bitcoins are lost.”Security is such a concern for consumers that Narayanan thinks Bitcoin is unlikely to find widespread use. So his team is working on a better security scheme that splits private keys across several different devices, such as an individual's desktop computer and smartphone, and requires a certain proportion of the fragments to approve a payment. “Neither reveals their share of the key to each other,” says Narayanan. “If one machine gets hacked, you're still OK because the hacker would need to hack the others to steal your private key. You'll hopefully notice the hack happened before they have the chance.”Other thefts have occurred because the private key needs to be combined with a random number to create a transaction signature. Some software—such as Bitcoin apps developed for Android smartphones—has generated random numbers improperly, making them easier to guess. This has allowed hackers to steal somewhere between several thousand and several million dollars' worth of bitcoins, says Courtois, who has been investigating such vulnerabilities. “It's embarrassing,” admits David Schwartz, chief cryptographer at cryptocurrency developer Ripple Labs in San Francisco, California. “We as an industry just seem to keep screwing up.”Into the ether The block chain is a remarkably powerful idea that could be applied to much more than just transaction records, says Gavin Wood, co-founder of Ethereum and chief technology officer of its foundation. One use might be to develop computerized, self-enforcing contracts that make a payment automatically when a task is complete. Others might include voting systems, crowdfunding platforms, and even other cryptocurrencies. Wood says that Ethereum is best used in situations for which central control is a weakness—for example, when users do not necessarily trust one another. In 2014, to make it easier to develop such applications, Wood and fellow programmer Vitalik Buterin devised a way to combine the block chain with a programming language. Ethereum raised 30,000 bitcoins through crowdfunding to commercialize this system.To prevent the basic cryptography-related mistakes that have plagued Bitcoin, Ethereum has recruited academic experts to audit its protocol. Shi and Juels are looking for ways that Ethereum could be abused by criminals. “The technology itself is morally neutral, but we should figure out how to shape it so that it can support policies designed to limit the amount of harm it can do,” says Juels.Like Bitcoin, Ethereum is not under anyone's direct control, so it operates outside national laws, says Wood. However, he adds that technologies such as music taping and the Internet were also considered extralegal at first, and seemed threatening to the status quo. How Bitcoin, Ethereum and their successors sit legally is therefore “something that, as a culture and society, we're going to have to come together to deal with”, he says.Juels suspects that Bitcoin, at least, will not last as an independent, decentralized entity. He points out how music streaming has moved from the decentralized model of peer-to-peer file-sharing service Napster to commercial operations such as Spotify and Apple Music. “One could imagine a similar trajectory for cryptocurrencies: when banks see they're successful, they'll want to create their own,” he says.Courtois disagrees. He calls Bitcoin “the Microsoft of cryptocurrency”, and maintains that its size and dominance mean that it is here to stay. As soon as any new innovations come along, he suggests, Bitcoin can adopt them and retain its leading position.Whatever the future holds for Bitcoin, Narayanan emphasizes that the community of developers and academics behind it is unique. “It's a remarkable body of knowledge, and we're going to be teaching this in computer science classes in 20 years, I'm certain of that.”";Bitcoin/blockchain;http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/entrepreneurs-explore-bitcoin-s-future/
8;Bitcoin startup Bitreserve is becoming a full-fledged financial services company and rebranding as Uphold. CEO Anthony Watson announced the move with a post titled “ Welcome to Uphold. The Internet of Money.”A press release notes that Uphold wants to be the world's leading cloud-based money platform, connecting the legacy and fragmented financial ecosystem with the future of money and finance. Uphold will be a members-only, member-to-member financial service for individuals, businesses, charities (including nonprofits and nongovernment organizations) and developers.Watson, former Nike CIO and member of the exclusive Fortune 40 Under 40 list, joined Bitreserve as president and chief operating officer earlier in 2015.“I am thrilled to join Bitreserve at such a pivotal moment in the evolution of cloud money and financial technology,” he said.Founded by CNET founder Halsey Minor in 2013, Bitreserve launched innovative features to shield its customers from the volatility of bitcoin by instantly locking deposits to a fiat currency selected by the customer, such as the U.S. dollar.“Bitreserve is on a mission to democratize the use of digital currency by protecting businesses and consumers from the risks inherent in the bitcoin model,” noted a Forbes review quoted on the Bitreserve website.In March, Bitreserve launched two new “bitcurrencies”: the bitrupee (BitINR) and bitpeso (BitMXN), pegged to two key developing world currencies – the Indian rupee and the Mexican peso – that allow Indian and Mexican customers to hold their local currencies on Bitreserve.“Today, Bitreserve takes its next great step forward on the journey to transform global financial services for the benefit of everyone, everywhere,” says Watson. “Together with the entire company, I’m proud and excited to announce that Bitreserve has become Uphold. But that’s just the beginning. We have additional exciting updates and announcements to share, from new market entries to new products and services and broader changes at our company.”Now, customers in 30 European Union countries, as well as Switzerland, can deposit money into Uphold via bank transfer or from credit and debit cards. In November, Uphold will begin to roll out its services to customers in the United States and China (limited beta), followed by India in January 2016 (limited beta).Members can fund their Uphold accounts by linking any bank account, debit and/or credit card (Visa and MasterCard initially), in addition to bitcoin and ‘the Voxel’ or ‘Voxels,’ a new form of virtual currency that the company and a partner will announce in the next few days.In December, Uphold plans to roll out multiple card and payment products, both physical and virtual (limited beta release). Members, based on their location and jurisdiction, will be able to choose among Visa, MasterCard or Discover to pay for goods and services, online or in person, using cards directly linked to their Uphold accounts.Watson’s post emphasizes that Uphold is not a bank and doesn’t lend or leverage members’ funds.“Our members can rest assured that value held in Uphold is 100 percent safe and secure and can be withdrawn, at any time, regardless of what is happening in the global economy,” says Watson. He adds that Uphold services will be mostly free, with some fees that will apply in special cases. For example, a fee of 2.75 percent will apply to members who choose to fund their Uphold account with a debit and/or credit card.Fortune notes that Bitreserve, now Uphold, is de-emphasizing the role of bitcoin in its business model and operations. That is shown by the new name without “bit” – “that oh-so-common prefix amongst digital currency startups” – and the new emphasis on financial services linked to traditional credit cards and bank accounts.“I’ll be surprised if bitcoin is here in five years,” Watson told Fortune . “The value of bitcoin isn’t the currency, but the technology. I think once the world becomes more accustomed and attuned to the platform of bitcoin, the noise will go away, and the currency will go away, too.”The company’s founder Halsey Minor, too, predicts that bitcoin as a currency “will get destroyed.”Minor and Watson’s remarks are certainly attuned to the prevailing mood in the financial services industry, which focuses on the advantages of using the blockchain technology for faster, cheaper and traceable transactions while considering the bitcoin currency as a temporary inconvenience. At the same time, it is worth bearing in mind that the current system – blockchain technology plus bitcoin currency – is proven to work.;Bitcoin/blockchain;https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitreserve-rebrands-as-uphold-pivots-to-new-financial-services-and-de-emphasizes-bitcoin-1445016363
9;BITMIN is a company that offers investors a platform with a lower entry barrier to mining, which is becoming more important due to the fact that the competition in Bitcoin mining has increased, and will continue to do so. The idea was conceived by Sathes Kumar, a person that wanted to give people a real chance at earning profit from Bitcoin mining after seeing the extremely high costs of competitive Bitcoin mining.  BITMIN is doing this by allowing investors to buy “shares” from their IndieGoGo Campaign page for $5, which is equivalent to 18 GH/s of SHA256 mining. This is different compared to traditional mining pools where individual users “pool” their hashing power into one collective entity. BITMIN will be using their personal resources as well as money raised in the crowdfund to purchase the hardware necessary to mine profitably at Bitcoins difficulty, and split the profits based on how much each individual investor contributed.Compared to other cloud mining companies, the rate is quite competitive. On top of the  promise of no maintenance cost and a one-time investment, (though reinvestment or additional buying installments are sure to be available) BITMIN is sure to be an attractive option for investors looking for a “set it and forget it” investment.“To overcome that risk we came up with the idea BITMIN. It is a cloud mining platform with 0 hiring cost only one time pay, it runs lifetime. The profit will be shared depends on their contribution for BITMIN.”BITMIN’s initial plan is to start with 50 TH/s of hashing power, with plans to gradually increase mining power as time passes by. BITMIN plans to use the following top end machine models to achieve their goal of 50 TH/s:•SP50 (110 TH/s)•BITCRANE Miner T-70 ( 7 TH/s )•Uranus V1 Miner (6 TH/s)•SP35 YUKON Miner ( 5.5 TH/s )•AntMiner S7 (4.86 TH/s)BITMIN states this the list is not definitive, and will change if more powerful, more efficient mining machines surface.“We change hardware to fulfill our goal more profit less power consumption. We buy hardware batch by batch, initially we planed to have 50 TH/s mining capacity then it will be increased gradually. ALL hardware purchases are done direct face to face with our supplier.”BITMIN is also over a quarter done with their IndieGoGo campaign, with a goal of $50,000 USD. BITMIN intends to use the money to “kickstart” (no pun intended) operations, as it claims to have everything else ready. With only $215 raised so far however, BITMIN may either not come off the ground or be faced with serious delays;Bitcoin/blockchain;http://insidebitcoins.com/news/bitmin-quarter-of-way-through-crowdfund-campaign-new-cloud-mining-company/35359
10;"If the first day of Scaling Bitcoin focused on fostering constructive dialogue, day two moved the conversation toward defining how that dialogue would proceed following the event and how such discussion could coalesce into a clearer vision for the open-source technology's future.Topics of discussion at the event still focused most directly on the larger question of how the bitcoin network could support increased transaction levels. However, these presentations were buoyed by musings on the trade-offs that will need to be weighed should the community want to honor the project's original democratizing vision.For example, some of the day's talks occasionally provided a broad, analytical look at current proposals, delving into the theoretical considerations such as how much capacity the bitcoin network would need to handle at scale and how the metric of scale could be defined.""When people talk about how bitcoin will have to scale, people throw out something about Visa processing 20,000 transactions per second or something,"" Harry Kalodner, of Princeton's Security and Privacy Research Group, said. ""There are other relevant factors though.""Kalodner went on to suggest using the bitcoin blockchain as a domain name storage system might add 294 million transactions to the network, a figure that doesn't include expected use cases such as in the Internet of Things. ""There are 245 million cars in the US,"" he added.In this light, sometimes contentious approaches to blockchain design such as the Lightning Network, which seeks to add payment channels to bitcoin, and BIP 102, a proposal to increase the blocksize to 2MB, were discussed but with the goal of providing clarity as to their intent.Paul Sztorc, author of the Truthcoin white paper, spoke about the existential issues facing the blocksize debate, and the need for arguments to be understood as the sum of underlying assumptions that must be qualified and stated clearly.Sztorc told attendees:""If someone hasn't stated what they think the blocksize does for bitcoin, you can't tell if what they said was right, or if you agree with the purpose they expressed. Not agreeing on the objective function is almost as bad as not agreeing on the constraint.""Elsewhere, the afternoon sessions featured 12 roundtables held to address community challenges. Some moved toward solutions, such as a proposed code of conduct that seeks to help the development community grow.""We need to have better resources for new entrants to the community, so they can be onboarded to the community without negativity,"" one presenter said.The proposed code of conduct is just one initiative that will be developed prior to being presented at a second Scaling Bitcoin conference in Hong Kong.To be held in December, the event is slated to feature presentations for scaling the bitcoin network, which will be evaluated against criteria developed at this weekend's event in Montreal.";Bitcoin/blockchain;http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoins-future-moves-into-focus-at-scaling-bitcoin-day-2/

12;Bitreserve, a startup that offered consumers digital wallets funded with Bitcoin, is rebranding itself as Uphold and starting to accept other currencies, making it the latest in a string of Bitcoin startups to further embrace fiat money.Beginning Tuesday, Uphold is allowing members (businesses, consumers and charities) in 33 European countries to fund their accounts with euros by bank transfer, credit cards, and debit cards. Next  month, the company will offer members in the United States and China the same services. (Previously, members would send Bitcoin and then could convert and hold it as one of 24 currencies, such as euros, Chinese Yuan or British pounds, or precious metal of their choice. They’d then have to convert it back to Bitcoin to move money out.) These new services are aimed at fulfilling Uphold’s goal to become the “Internet of money.”“When I launched Bitreserve the idea was that, using the cloud and cloud money, you could eliminate all expenses related to anything monetary — the movement and conversion of money in all forms: foreign exchange, bounced checks, remittance fees,” says founder and chairman Halsey Minor, who also founded CNET. “If you’re making money by moving money — credit cards, remittances, bounced check fees — all of those fees, we will take out in the next five years.”;Bitcoin/blockchain;http://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2015/10/14/bitcoin-startup-bitreserve-rebrands-as-uphold-begins-rollout-of-services-in-euros-dollars/
13;In its latest report called the Internet Organised Crime Threat Assessment for 2015, Europol outlined the state of cybercrime threats in the European Union. The report mentions bitcoin and virtual currencies, claiming that it accounts for roughly 40% of criminal-to-criminal transactions online.This follows the agency’s statement indicating that cryptocurrencies promote the crime-as-a-service business model, wherein bitcoin was highlighted for its role in facilitating money laundering. The cryptocurrency is known for its anonymous transactions, which Europol says makes it “heavily abused by criminals.”Bitcoin and CrimeThe Europol report also mentioned the use of bitcoin and other digital currencies on OpenBazaar, which is a decentralized marketplace run by peer-to-peer transactions. This has been criticized for mimicking the now-defunct Silk Road, which was known as a haven for cybercriminals, illegal dealings, and drug trades on the Dark Web.Europol noted that the peer-to-peer nature of OpenBazaar means that there would be no single entity to be monitored by law enforcement officials. This makes intervention and investigation a huge challenge, mirroring the other issues that regulatory agencies are currently facing with bitcoin.With that, the report recommended that law enforcement officials pay particular attention to decentralized marketplaces like OpenBazaar to gain a better understanding of how bitcoin and other emerging technologies are being used. It also encouraged collaboration among security agencies to monitor the “alternate payment community” as well.“Any regulation of cryptocurrencies would likely only be applicable and enforceable when applied to identifiable users such as those providing exchange services. The inability to attribute transactions to end users makes it difficult to imagine how any regulation could be enforced for everyday users,” the report concluded.

15;In its first civil enforcement action against a virtual currency exchange, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) levied a $700,000 fine on San Francisco-based Ripple Labs for violating the Bank Secrecy Act.Following an investigation by U.S. Attorney’s Office, the IRS, and FinCEN, Ripple Labs has agreed to pay the fine and take steps to comply with federal regulations. Ripple Labs’ crypocurrency, called XRP, has the second largest market cap after Bitcoin, according to FinCEN.On Tuesday, FinCEN and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California jointly announced civil charges against Ripple Labs for failing to register as a money services business with FinCEN and for failing to maintain anti-money laundering programs. According to the Attorney’s Office, Ripple Labs failed to file a suspicious activity report when it negotiated a $250,000 transaction with a former felon convicted of dealing with explosive devices in 2013. Additionally, the government claims Ripple Labs sold XRP without being registered with FinCEN, earning $1.3 million April 2013 alone.The U.S. Attorney’s Office agreed to drop criminal charges in exchange for Ripple Labs acknowledging a list of violations and agreeing to pay a $450,000 forfeiture, which will be applied to the $700,000 fine.

16;"When the digital currency Bitcoin came to life in January 2009, it was noticed by almost no one apart from the handful of programmers who followed cryptography discussion groups. Its origins were shadowy: it had been conceived the previous year by a still-mysterious person or group known only by the alias Satoshi Nakamoto1. And its purpose seemed quixotic: Bitcoin was to be a 'cryptocurrency', in which strong encryption algorithms were exploited in a new way to secure transactions. Users' identities would be shielded by pseudonyms. Records would be completely decentralized. And no one would be in charge — not governments, not banks, not even Nakamoto.Yet the idea caught on. Today, there are some 14.6 million Bitcoin units in circulation. Called bitcoins with a lowercase 'b', they have a collective market value of around US$3.4 billion. Some of this growth is attributable to criminals taking advantage of the anonymity for drug trafficking and worse. But the system is also drawing interest from financial institutions such as JP Morgan Chase, which think it could streamline their internal payment processing and cut international transaction costs. It has inspired the creation of some 700 other cryptocurrencies. And on 15 September, Bitcoin officially came of age in academia with the launch of Ledger, the first journal dedicated to cryptocurrency research.What fascinates academics and entrepreneurs alike is the innovation at Bitcoin's core. Known as the block chain, it serves as the official online ledger of every Bitcoin transaction, dating back to the beginning. It is also the data structure that allows those records to be updated with minimal risk of hacking or tampering — even though the block chain is copied across the entire network of computers running Bitcoin software, and the owners of those computers do not necessarily know or trust one another.Many people see this block-chain architecture as the template for a host of other applications, including self-enforcing contracts and secure systems for online voting and crowdfunding. This is the goal of Ethereum, a block-chain-based system launched in July by the non-profit Ethereum Foundation, based in Baar, Switzerland. And it is the research agenda of the Initiative for CryptoCurrencies and Contracts (IC3), an academic consortium also launched in July, and led by Cornell University in Ithaca, New York.Nicolas Courtois, a cryptographer at University College London, says that the Bitcoin block chain could be “the most important invention of the twenty-first century” — if only Bitcoin were not constantly shooting itself in the foot.Several shortcomings have become apparent in Bitcoin's implementation of the block-chain idea. Security, for example, is far from perfect: there have been more than 40 known thefts and seizures of bitcoins, several incurring losses of more than $1 million apiece.Cryptocurrency firms and researchers are attacking the problem with tools such as game theory and advanced cryptographic methods. “Cryptocurrencies are unlike many other systems, in that extremely subtle mathematical bugs can have catastrophic consequences,” says Ari Juels, co-director of IC3. “And I think when weaknesses surface there will be a need to appeal to the academic community where the relevant expertise resides.”Academic interest in cryptocurrencies and their predecessors goes back at least two decades, with much of the early work spearheaded by cryptographer David Chaum. While working at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, Chaum wanted to give buyers privacy and safety. So in 1990 he founded one of the earliest digital currencies, DigiCash, which offered users anonymity through cryptographic protocols of his own devising.DigiCash went bankrupt in 1998 — partly because it had a centralized organization akin to a traditional bank, yet never managed to fit in with the financial industry and its regulations. But aspects of its philosophy re-emerged ten years later in Nakamoto's design for Bitcoin. That design also incorporated crowdsourcing and peer-to-peer networking — both of which help to avoid centralized control. Anyone is welcome to participate: it is just a matter of going online and running the open-source Bitcoin software. Users' computers form a network in which each machine is home to one constantly updated copy of the block chain.Nakamoto's central challenge with this wide-open system was the need to make sure that no one could find a way to rewrite the ledger and spend the same bitcoins twice — in effect, stealing bitcoins. His solution was to turn the addition of new transactions to the ledger into a competition: an activity that has come to be known as mining Mining starts with incoming Bitcoin transactions, which are continuously broadcast to every computer on the network. These are collected by 'miners' — the groups or individuals who choose to participate — who start competing for the right to bundle transactions into a new block. The winner is the first to broadcast a 'proof of work' — a solution showing that he or she has solved an otherwise meaningless mathematical puzzle that involves encrypted data from the previous block, and lots of computerized trial and error. The winning block is broadcast through the Bitcoin network and added to the block chain, with the proof of work providing an all but unbreakable link. The block chain is currently almost 400,000 blocks long.In principle, this competition keeps the block chain secure because the puzzle is too hard for any one miner to solve every time. This means that no one will ever gain access to the encrypted links in the block chain and the ability to rewrite the ledger.Mining is also a way to steadily increase the bitcoin supply: the miner who wins each block gets a reward, currently 25 new bitcoins. That is worth almost $6,000 at today's prices. Nakamoto's design controls the supply increase by automatically adjusting the difficulty of the puzzle so that a new block is added roughly every ten minutes. In addition, the reward for creating a block decreases by half roughly every four years. The goal is to limit the supply to a maximum of 21 million bitcoins.The network cannot determine the value of bitcoins relative to standard currencies, or real-world goods and services. That has been left to market forces, with people trading bitcoins on online exchanges. One result is that the market price has gyrated spectacularly — especially in 2013, when the asking price soared from $13 per bitcoin in January to around $1,200 in December. That would have made the first real-world products ever paid for with the cryptocurrency — a pair of Papa John's pizzas, purchased for 10,000 bitcoins on 22 May 2010 — worth almost $12 million.It did not take long for the problems with Bitcoin to become apparent. For example, because users are allowed to mask their identity with pseudonyms, the currency is perfect for screening criminal activity. That was behind the success of the online black market Silk Road, which the FBI shut down in 2013; its founder was sentenced to life in prison in May this year. But Bitcoin also had a key role in funding the whistle-blowing website WikiLeaks — an outcome that some would call beneficial. It is difficult for society to work out a legal framework to differentiate between good and bad uses of this technology, says Arvind Narayanan, a computer scientist at Princeton University in New Jersey. “How do you regulate around Bitcoin without banning the technology itself?” he asks.Other issues surfaced with Bitcoin's mining procedure. As the currency has gained value, for example, mining competition has become fiercer, with increasingly specialized computers solving the puzzles ever faster. Courtois, who has found ways to streamline the puzzle-solving process2, says that at one point he was successfully earning $200 a day through mining. The rivalry has driven the establishment of large Bitcoin-mining centres in Iceland, where cooling for the computers is cheap. According to one estimate from 2014, Bitcoin miners collectively consumed as much power as the whole of Ireland3.Intensified Bitcoin mining has also led individual miners to pool their computational resources. Last year, the largest mining pool, GHash.IO, briefly exceeded 50% of total Bitcoin mining power — which is problematic because anyone who controls more than half of the mining power could start beating everyone else in the race to add blocks. This would effectively give them control of the transaction ledger and allow them to spend the same bitcoins over and over again. This is not just a theoretical possibility. Successful '51% attacks' — efforts to dominate mining power — have already been mounted against smaller cryptocurrencies such as Terracoin and Coiledcoin; the latter was so badly damaged that it ceased operation.To reduce the threat from mining pools, some existing cryptocurrencies, such as Litecoin, use puzzles that call more on computer memory than on processing power — a shift that tends to make it more costly to build the kind of specialized computers that the pools favour. Another approach, developed by IC3 co-director Elaine Shi and her collaborators4, enlists a helpful kind of theft. “We are cryptographically ensuring that pool members can always steal the reward for themselves without being detected,” explains Shi. Their supposition is that miners would not trust each other enough to form into pools if their fellow pool members could easily waltz off with the rewards without sharing. They have built a prototype of the algorithm, and are hoping to see it tested in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.Another problem is the profligate amount of electricity used in Bitcoin mining. To reduce wastage, researchers including Shi and Juels have proposed a currency called Permacoin5. Its proof of work would require miners to create a distributed archive for valuable data such as medical records, or the output of a gene-sequencing centre. This would not save energy, but would at least put it to better use.The security of cryptocurrencies is another huge concern. The many thefts of bitcoins do not result from the block-chain structure, says Narayanan, but from Bitcoin's use of standard digital-signature technology. In digital signatures, he explains, people have two numeric keys: a public one that they give to others as an address to send money to, and a private one that they use to approve transactions. But the security of that private key is only as good as the security of the machine that stores it, he says. “If somebody hacks your computer, for example, and steals your private keys, then essentially all of your bitcoins are lost.”Security is such a concern for consumers that Narayanan thinks Bitcoin is unlikely to find widespread use. So his team is working on a better security scheme that splits private keys across several different devices, such as an individual's desktop computer and smartphone, and requires a certain proportion of the fragments to approve a payment6. “Neither reveals their share of the key to each other,” says Narayanan. “If one machine gets hacked, you're still OK because the hacker would need to hack the others to steal your private key. You'll hopefully notice the hack happened before they have the chance.”Other thefts have occurred because the private key needs to be combined with a random number to create a transaction signature. Some software — such as Bitcoin apps developed for Android smartphones — has generated random numbers improperly, making them easier to guess. This has allowed hackers to steal somewhere between several thousand and several million dollars' worth of bitcoins, says Courtois, who has been investigating such vulnerabilities7. “It's embarrassing,” admits David Schwartz, chief cryptographer at cryptocurrency developer Ripple Labs in San Francisco, California. “We as an industry just seem to keep screwing up.”The block chain is a remarkably powerful idea that could be applied to much more than just transaction records, says Gavin Wood, co-founder of Ethereum and chief technology officer of its foundation. One use might be to develop computerized, self-enforcing contracts that make a payment automatically when a task is complete. Others might include voting systems, crowdfunding platforms, and even other cryptocurrencies. Wood says that Ethereum is best used in situations for which central control is a weakness — for example, when users do not necessarily trust one another. In 2014, to make it easier to develop such applications, Wood and fellow programmer Vitalik Buterin devised a way to combine the block chain with a programming language. Ethereum raised 30,000 bitcoins through crowdfunding to commercialize this system.To prevent the basic cryptography-related mistakes that have plagued Bitcoin, Ethereum has recruited academic experts to audit its protocol. Shi and Juels are looking for ways that Ethereum could be abused by criminals8. “The technology itself is morally neutral, but we should figure out how to shape it so that it can support policies designed to limit the amount of harm it can do,” says Juels.Like Bitcoin, Ethereum is not under anyone's direct control, so it operates outside national laws, says Wood. However, he adds that technologies such as music taping and the Internet were also considered extralegal at first, and seemed threatening to the status quo. How Bitcoin, Ethereum and their successors sit legally is therefore “something that, as a culture and society, we're going to have to come together to deal with”, he says.Juels suspects that Bitcoin, at least, will not last as an independent, decentralized entity. He points out how music streaming has moved from the decentralized model of peer-to-peer file-sharing service Napster to commercial operations such as Spotify and Apple Music. “One could imagine a similar trajectory for cryptocurrencies: when banks see they're successful, they'll want to create their own,” he says.Courtois disagrees. He calls Bitcoin “the Microsoft of cryptocurrency”, and maintains that its size and dominance mean that it is here to stay. As soon as any new innovations come along, he suggests, Bitcoin can adopt them and retain its leading position.Whatever the future holds for Bitcoin, Narayanan emphasizes that the community of developers and academics behind it is unique. “It's a remarkable body of knowledge, and we're going to be teaching this in computer science classes in 20 years, I'm certain of that.”";Bitcoin/blockchain;http://www.nature.com/news/the-future-of-cryptocurrencies-bitcoin-and-beyond-1.18447
17;You may start to see a lot more bitcoin ATM machines in the near future.Currently, there are 119 bitcoin ATM machines running in the U.S. But a new report from ATM Marketplace, a directory of product and service providers for the ATM industry, claims that by next year, the number could be in the thousands.A new trend has entrepreneurs installing Bitcoin software into ATM machines. This creates a new opportunity with the trendy digital currency, explains BusinessOpportunities.biz in an overview of the 40 page report.The guide also offers an overview of eight of the largest manufacturers of bitcoin ATM machines: BitAccess, BitXatm.com, Coin Outlet, General Bytes, Genesis Coin, Lamassu, Robocoin and Skyhook.The alternative currency would be offered alongside traditional money through the ATM generating additional revenue for owners.Promoters claim earning potential for machines providing the new bitcoin service could be quite high.First, transaction fees for buying and selling at bitcoin ATMs is 6 percent, the report says. In addition, ATM operators can sell bitcoins at a higher price than they paid for them, which is known as making money on currency “float.”The report claims ATMs installed in prime locations have generated revenue of between $70,000 and $300,000. This has allowed fortunate ATM operators to pay off the cost of their machines in only three to nine months.However, there is a darker side to the Bitcoin story.Evaluating the Future of Bitcoin ATM MachinesWhile some online entrepreneurs, favor bitcoins because it is not regulated by governments or banks, other small business owners see the currency’s limits.Supporters claim using bitcoins is effective for selling virtual goods like software or premium content. This is because it may cut down on the cost incurred from selling in foreign markets.On the other hand, bitcoins are also known to be extremely volatile as a currency.In fact, a 2013 study by researchers at Southern Methodist and Carnegie Melon universities turned up some disturbing data.The study found that about 45 percent of all bitcoin exchanges, where bitcoins are traded for national currencies at a fluctuating rate had actually failed. Only six percent of them even attempting to refund deposits made by users, the study found.Where does this leave bitcoin ATM machines? It’s uncertain. But it may be a reason to exercise caution when exploring bitcoin ATM opportunities.Still, the report, entitled “Bitcoin ATMs 101: Opportunities for the IAD” maintains bitcoin ATM machines offer a secure way to buy and sell the digital currency.And it’s clear their popularity won’t be waning anytime soon.Consumerist.com describes bitcoins as “the world’s biggest cryptocurrency.” The digital form of money was introduced in 2009 and is the longest-standing, best-known and most widely traded of its kind in the world.Bitcoin spelled with an upper-case B refers to the software and the system, which is open-source. When the word is spelled with a lower-case b, it refers to the actual money.As of March 4, 2014, the value of one bitcoin equaled approximately $693 in U.S. currency. Also, as of that date, there was an equivalent of $8.5 billion in bitcoins worldwide.;Bitcoin/blockchain;http://smallbiztrends.com/2015/07/bitcoin-atm-machines.html
18;One of the most prominent features of the BitX Smart Wallet is the option for users to buy and sell Bitcoin from within the application itself. However, as you would come to expect from a Bitcoin exchange, this functionality only seems to be available to users on their own problem. Furthermore, this feature is limited to supported regions only, making it unavailable for specific countries. Regardless of its limited availability, it is a positive trend to see wallet developers enable in-app trades of Bitcoin against fiat currency. For novice users, these types of mobile Bitcoin wallets will be very useful, as they can do everything they need and want within one application, rather than opening a browser window to trade Bitcoin. Navigation is a key element of mobile Bitcoin wallets, and BitX has taken a slightly different direction compared to the competition. By using a card-based navigation system, users can customize their financial experience within the mobile Bitcoin wallet. Less-used or irrelevant cards can be swiped away by the user, to keep the application clutter-free. The reason why this is called a “Smart Wallet” is because this app has been designed to learn more about user behavior. As a direct result, users will receive customized cards to enrich their experience while using the BitX Smart Wallet. Further improvements to this card systems will be made over the coming months, and users can submit their feedback here.Even mobile Bitcoin wallets have to evolve over time and branch out to support other digital currencies as well. BitX Smart Wallet has not done that just yet, but the application supported balances in both Bitcoin and fiat currency. Once again, a possibly beneficial tool for novice Bitcoin users, albeit experienced users may not be blown away by this option. One major feature is not available yet, but BitX has announced it on their blog. The plan is to allow for the generation of virtual credit card numbers within the BitX Smart Wallet, giving users the option to spend Bitcoin anywhere in the world.  ;Bitcoin/blockchain;http://insidebitcoins.com/news/bitx-smart-wallet-launched-for-mobile-bitcoin-users/35218
19;Bitcoin has been around for about seven years and it has achieved great heights in such a short span. While bitcoin is already being adopted by a considerable number of people across the world, the technology that powers bitcoin transactions has become a bigger hit. Blockchain technology is behind all bitcoin transactions. Blockchain is a secure and transparent ledger that records each and every transaction that happens over the bitcoin network. All transactions needs to be confirmed on blockchain and the entry recorded to ensure there is no double spending on fraudulent transactions. Apart from bitcoin transactional data, blockchain can also record non-transactional data.Banks and BlockchainsBlockchain technology has found its way into various applications other than bitcoin transactions. The use of blockchain technology varies from simple laboratory data management applications to secure proprietary financial transaction tools dealing with banking and securities. Recently we have seen banks experimenting with blockchain technology to evaluate its use in their day to day operations. Few banks are already using Ripple network on an experimental basis while a group of international banks work on creating a proprietary blockchain, better known as federated blockchain. The federated blockchain is being created with plans to link all these banks to a network, similar to that of bitcoin network and use the network to transfer funds from one bank/branch to another instantly while bypassing the conventional routes.Even though the research is currently still in the initial stages, its implementation will not take much time. However, wide spread adoption is another question. Banks and corporations are giants, taking a long time before they could achieve widespread implementation. But once implemented, it may spell doom to bitcoin as we know it today. It is highly unlikely for banks and financial institutions to adopt bitcoin or any other open source technology on an as-is basis. So, the probability of banks adopting their own cryptocurrency or a token is very high.Once blockchain technology is implemented in banks across the world, the turnaround time for fund transfers will fall rapidly. Banks will be able to process transactions at the same rate as bitcoin transactions. The transaction fees associated with fund transfers will also fall drastically as banks will be able to successfully circumvent SWIFT network and central banks. These benefits will be passed on to customers. In short, banking customers will be able to enjoy almost all the benefits bitcoin currently offers through the banking system. Once banks start processing transactions over blockchain, these crypto tokens used by banks will be readily convertible to local fiat currency without the need of any third party exchanges.Decentralized no moreBitcoin is popular mainly because it offers fast, easy and an economical way to transfer funds. If mainstream banking sector begins to offer all these benefits, then people will start opting for conventional banks over bitcoin. In addition to it, few mining pools are growing bigger each day. The top three bitcoin mining pools put together control over 50 percent of the bitcoin hashrate and F2pool alone has a share of close to 25 percent of total available bitcoin hashrate. If the trend continues, bitcoin may not stay decentralized for a long time. Once people realize that the decentralized nature of bitcoin network is about to be compromised, they might start looking for other options. Bitcoin network’s trouble reaching a consensus, if continued will compound the problem and may lead to an early downfall of our much beloved cryptocurrency.;Bitcoin/blockchain;http://www.newsbtc.com/2015/09/27/banks-bitcoin-and-blockchian-a-recipe-for-downfall/
20;"When it comes to making a purchase, some people prefer to pay in cash or even put it on a card. But now there is another option. Bitcoins are a relatively new online currency that has grabbed the attention of several businesses, including some here in Amarillo.""It's an accepted form of payment that you can use electronically,"" said Neil Mere, an Assistant Professor of Economics at West Texas A&M University.The coins can be purchased online with actual money and then can be used digitally on a smart phone to transfer from person to person or business in what's being called a ""virtual wallet."" The transactions between Bitcoin owners can be made in seconds and cuts out the actual bank. At Class 1 Dental, they're jumping on the trend. 'There is no third party involved. We don't have to rely on a bank or a credit card company so we can avoid those transactions fees that sometimes our customers have to pay and we always have to pay to help keep our services at a reasonable rate,"" Cindy Schmidt, DDS told us.Green Gorilla is another business in Amarillo that uses Bitcoins.

However, Meredith still has his reservations.""Some people like to have a little bit of Bitcoin because it's a novelty, it's sort of a new thing so they get a little bit of joy of playing with some Bitcoin but I don't think it's going to catch on as widespread as say the U.S. dollar,"" he said.

21;"Just over a year ago, Halsey Minor quietly launched Bitreserve, a site that allowed customers to convert the digital currency bitcoin into other currencies as well as precious metals.Since then, the CNET founder and Salesforce cofounder has made some major moves—like hiring former Nike CIO Anthony Watson and then quickly making him Bitreserve’s CEO. Today, the company looks very different indeed. On Wednesday, Bitreserve effectively relaunches, with a broader array of deposit options and with a new name: Uphold.The name may remind you of a certain millennial news site with clicky, exclamatory headlines. But Watson says it’s part nod to the cloud (“up”), part nod to the company’s reserve of funds (“hold”). Most important: the absence of “bit,” that oh-so-common prefix amongst digital currency startups. When Bitreserve first launched, customers could convert bitcoin into a range of different currencies, including the dollar, euro, franc, peso, pound, or metals like gold, silver, and platinum—but they had to start with bitcoin. As of Wednesday, customers in 30 different E.U. countries can deposit money into Uphold via bank transfer or from credit and debit cards. And come November, customers in the U.S. and China will be able to do so. The ability to start with something other than bitcoin is a significant shift for Uphold from the digital currency world into the mainstream financial world—now it is targeting customers beyond those familiar with bitcoin.This is the next step in what Watson says is the company’s goal of democratizing finance. “Our mission is to make it easy and frictionless for anyone, anywhere to move, convert, hold and transact in any form of money or commodity securely, instantly and for free,” he says. But along with the name change, this news also reflects Uphold’s aim of no longer being seen as a bitcoin startup.Indeed, one of the most interesting aspects of this bitcoin company is that its founder and CEO aren’t bitcoin believers. Bitcoin and its blockchain—the public, cloud-based ledger that records all transactions of the digital currency—had to be Bitreserve’s starting point because of the lack of regulation and fast time-to-market it allowed. But Minor says Uphold is about “breaking down all of the banks into a single reserve—we need a dollar reserve, we need a pound reserve. We offer that.”Of course, the limitation here is that your money sits in the ‘bank’ of Uphold—and the person you’re sending funds to must also be an Uphold member. But Minor has an answer for that. “Let’s say you convert some money to gold,” he says. “That gold bar sits in a vault in Switzerland, and it doesn’t move, just the marker moves. Instead of money having to move from bank to bank, it just moves from account to account. Bitcoin created that. It’s like a loophole in the wall; it allowed people to be able to hold value without having to connect to a bank. But now we offer 24 currencies, four metals, and $400 million in value has been exchanged [on Bitreserve], instantaneously, and at no cost.”Watson sounds even more negative on bitcoin. “I’ll be surprised if bitcoin is here in five years,” he has told Fortune. “The value of bitcoin isn’t the currency, but the technology. I think once the world becomes more accustomed and attuned to the platform of bitcoin, the noise will go away, and the currency will go away too. The real transformation is the idea of taking all barriers down… Whatever currency or commodity you want to transact in, you can, and you can do it for free.” (Uphold charges a fee for credit and debit card deposits, and for withdrawals above a certain amount.)Minor, too, predicts that bitcoin as a currency “will get destroyed.” He likens the coin’s current market cap—about $3.7 billion—to “an accounting mistake or rounding error that Bank of America makes.” He says that finding staffers with business bona fides, not just bitcoin veterans, was an intentional move. “I did what most companies in fintech haven’t done, I went and got people with solid, serious banking credentials,” Minor says. “I got the CISO of MasterCard, the CIO of Barclays. And the reason they came is they were going to a digital currency company, not a bitcoin company.”Think of Uphold as more of a vault than a bank. In contrast to the traditional banking system, which runs wire transfers through the Automated Clearing House, Uphold’s value proposition is the ability to send someone money more quickly and more cheaply. Once its new capabilities launch next month in the U.S., Minor boasts, “You will be able to connect to your bank account in the United States, move money from your bank into Bitreserve, convert it into Euros, and move it into your bank account in Europe—at zero cost.”You might wonder—are there really so many people who are itching to do that? “Well, the entire German automotive industry,” Minor says, and laughs.Watson says the new options make Uphold “revolutionary.” Now that customers can deposit something other than bitcoin, Watson and Minor will soon find out if people outside of the digital currency space agree.";Bitcoin/blockchain;http://fortune.com/2015/10/14/bitreserve-bitcoin-uphold/
22;21 is a mysterious Bitcoin hardware and mining startup backed by Andreessen Horowitz that unwrapped its first product earlier this year. A few weeks ago, they unveiled and began pre-selling a computer that has native hardware and software support for the Bitcoin protocol.Co-founder Balaji Srinivasan, who previously started bioinformatics and gene testing company Counsyl, said the vision is akin to how PCs and operating systems like Windows 95 began to include TCP/IP support natively in the 1990s, opening the door for widespread Internet adoption. If machines and phones start having native Bitcoin support, it enables them to support infinitely small transactions off the Bitcoin protocol in exchange for whatever goods and services a person or machine wants. One popular example idea is requiring infinitesimally small payments for e-mail, which would curb spam.“First, you had the worldwide Internet. Then the social Internet,” Srinivasan said. “Then this is the machine payable Internet.”It also cuts the barrier to participating or developing with the Bitcoin protocol dramatically. Srinivasan said that there are maybe 1,000 developers worldwide who really know how to work with the protocol.“There’s a tiny number of Bitcoin wizards, and an enormous number of smart developers that have no on-ramp to Bitcoin,” Srinivasan said. “We need to make that onramp easier.”Today, after unveiling the first device, 21 has hired Saivann Carignan, David Harding and Will Binns, three of the top contributors to Bitcoin.org. They’re opening an education platform that 21 is using to make software development for the Bitcoin protocol much more accessible and easier to understand. It will cover topics from digital signatures to mining. That will help developers, who want to use 21’s computer, level up with their software skills.“Our computer is the easiest way for a developer to get started writing software for Bitcoin,” he said. “You don’t have to spend days downloading the blockchain, which is like going and buying some floppy disks and going through an installation process.”To expand all of the tutorials, 21 is paying contributors from anywhere in the world a small fee of up to $200 in Bitcoin if they translate or add documentation.Srinivasan envisions the tutorials as a way of teaching and familiarizing a whole army of Bitcoin developers. “We have the investors or connections to get our chip baked into a line of electronics by default. But we also need enough developer traction over the next year or so.”;Bitcoin/blockchain;http://techcrunch.com/2015/10/08/bitcoin-21-balaji/

For example, three days for stock trading. With Openchain, it is possible to handle the trade and the settlement as a single operation, reducing both costs and counterparty risks.""Openchain vs bitcoinThe main difference between Openchain and bitcoin's blockchain, Charlon said, resides in the type of assets that his product is designed to handle.According to Charlon – previously a software development engineer at Microsoft – bitcoin ""is a very special asset ... built for censorship resistance"".He added:ADVERTISEMENT""The entire design of bitcoin comes from that requirement, with proof-of-work being at the core of that design. We certainly appreciate the incredible innovation around proof-of-work and censorship-resistant assets, but when banks talk about blockchain technology, they are really not interested in censorship resistance.""Similarly to bitcoin's blockchain, Charlon claimed Openchain is both fully transparent and auditable.""Anyone can connect to a validating node, and receive a real-time copy of the transactions being validated,"" said the founder, adding: ""Openchain is also secured by digital signatures, which make it impossible to counterfeit a transaction.""One notable difference with bitcoin, Charlon said, is the way in which Openchain deals with transactions to avoid confirmation delays:""Openchain gets rid of blocks, and chains transactions directly to each other, which means you can get instant transaction confirmation.""CompetitionDistributed ledger technology has become increasingly popular in recent months, with various companies such as Digital Asset Holdings – which acquired Hyperledger – emerging in the space.ItBit also revealed details about its top-secret Bankchain project, a private consensus-based ledger system which also targets financial organisations.Speaking about its competitors, Charlon said:""The first big difference with all those companies is that our product is open source and ready to use today. None of these companies have released anything to date, and most of them (if not all) are making their software proprietary.""Although he declined to divulge specifics, Charlon said a few companies had already experimented with a private beta of Openchain.""The feedback we have received so far is very positive.

29;"Santander Group, the Spanish banking giant, has invested several million dollars in Ripple, one of the most prominent startups in the hotly discussed field of distributed-ledger technology.The San Francisco firm, which has shortened its name from Ripple Labs, also plans to introduce a new payments technology, known as Interledger, which it claims will offer banks the same speed and cost benefits as the three-year-old Ripple network but with improved privacy and scalability. Interledger will also allow banks to pay transaction fees in local currencies rather than having to use XRP, the native digital currency of the Ripple network. Ripple is also unveiling a pair of enterprise software solutions for cross-currency settlement and foreign exchange market-making.Santander's fintech mavens recently highlighted distributed ledger technology (of which Ripple's offerings are one example) as one that banks should consider to modernize their operations. A couple of weeks later, Santander's U.S. consumer unit named as its new chairman former JPMorgan Chase executive Blythe Masters, now CEO of the blockchain technology startup Digital Asset Holdings. The Spanish bank is investing in Ripple as U.S. payments institutions strive to modernize the existing payments architecture to build a faster system.Neither party would say how much Santander invested in Ripple. The startup said the infusion will bring its series A venture capital funding round to $32 million. Ripple said in May that it had raised a cumulative $28 million, and since no new investors other than Santander have been announced since then, it is presumed that the bank put in around $4 million.Earlier this year Ripple was hit with an enforcement action over its failure as a virtual currency exchanger to register as a money-services business and report suspicious transactions in XRP. Ripple agreed as part of the settlement to improve its anti-money-laundering compliance and limit XRP transactions to registered money-services businesses.Ripple's technology could help modernize the banking infrastructure, Mariano Belinky, managing partner of Santander InnoVentures, the bank's venture capital arm, said in a press release Tuesday.""Ripple possesses the talent, technology, and momentum to address many of these scenarios, and [we] are actively exploring where and how best to apply Ripple technology inside the bank,"" he said.According to Ripple, the technology makes it possible for banks — currently hampered by $1.6 trillion annually in transaction-related fees — to skirt around correspondent banks and pay each other directly, eliminating processing fees, lowering operational costs and compressing the cost of prefunding accounts.""Outmoded payment infrastructure forces banks and their corporate customers to prefund foreign accounts for international payments, but then provides few assurances that cross-border transactions will actually settle,"" Ripple CEO and co-founder Chris Larsen said in the press release";Bitcoin/blockchain;http://www.americanbanker.com/news/bank-technology/
30;"Blockchain-based supply chain startup Wave graduated from the TechStars FinTech accelerator this week, in the process becoming the third firm to ink a deal with UK bank Barclays, which provides non-monetary support to the startup program.Though the deal may not be as impactful to the industry at large as Barclays's attempt to lift its banking blockade on bitcoin businesses with the help of Chainalysis, the bank's interest in Wave signals that enterprise banks may be interested in the application of the blockchain to trade finance.Formerly called OGYDocs, Wave's product will be leveraged by Barclays Corporate Bank in a bid to help business clients reduce costs associated with supply chain management. The deal brings a high-profile client to the startup, which is toiling on similar grounds as blockchain trade finance startups including Gazebo and Skuchain.In interview, Wave founder Gadi Ruschin suggested that this use case was one of the more potentially lucrative for the industry. Digital solutions based on the blockchain, he said, can already outperform pen-and-paper processes used today.Ruschin told CoinDesk:""Blockchain is a very good solution to eliminate the pain in international trade, because you have an industry that combines all industries, because all industries are either importers or exporters at some level. You have the carrier, the bank and the customer and it's hard to find one centralized entity everyone can work with.""Even more advantageous, Ruschin added, is that Wave's products don't threaten to remove any intermediaries.""We can change the industry without stepping on anyone's toes,"" he said.Wave incorporates industry standard workflows, according to the company, replacing printed documents with versions that are stored electronically in blockchain transaction metadata.""The document will go between the parties on the supply chain [over the blockchain], but if they want to change ownership, the doc will be sent to the recipient, and the sender will publish a transaction that moves the document,"" Ruschin explained.Wave is currently composed of three team members, and will base its operations in Tel Aviv following graduation from the TechStars program.Playing with fireThough core to its product, Ruschin said Wave will use the blockchain ""as little as possible"" in its design due to the ongoing uncertainty around how the technology is treated under law.""We're not putting anything on the blockchain,"" Ruschin emphasized, ""just using it to manage the ownership of each document or good in transport.""He said Wave is developing a ""layer"" of technology that can interact with any blockchain, and that today it is being shaped on the bitcoin and litecoin testnets, versions of the protocols that include current rules but do not use real digital currencies.Ruschin suggested that it's not yet clear which blockchain Wave will use at launch, but that it is open to using private alternatives to bitcoin due to the ""regulation problem"" facing the industry.""We prefer not to play with fire to be honest,"" he said.Bill of ladingIn particular, Wave will focus on integrating its product in one part of the supply chain process, seeking to take the place of traditional bills of lading (BoL), documents issued by carriers that include details about a shipment, generally the type of good, quantity and destination, and give title of the property to a certain party.Ruschin explained carriers primarily deal with companies that have finished producing goods that need to be transported internationally, and that they in turn hand over BoLs to exporters.""As the exporter, once you receive the bill of lading, you add the invoice, the certificates that go along the supply chain and you put it all in an envelope and you bring it to your local bank,"" he said. ""They check it, approve it and send it to [the recipient]. They'll check all the documents, and then this is the time they trigger the receipt.""When the recipient's bank receives the BoL, payments are then triggered to the supplier and goods are released.""All these processes are based on antiquated tools on the supply chain,"" Ruschin said seeking to highlight the pain point Wave's product will address. ""In any paper-based process there are problems and forgeries.""Client acquisitionRuschin contends the biggest challenge facing Wave is not technology, but reaching the scale it would need for its product to be successful.As a starting point, he said the deal with Barclays would be beneficial due to its status as an international bank and position in global trade.""They are extremely supportive regarding everyone, but specifically about us because they are a player in this market and they have signed an agreement with us. We have already simulated the functionality of how the product would work, and they are committed to it,"" he continued, calling the firm a ""very big target customer"".Ruschin said Wave is in talks with other, unidentified customers, and that it benefits from the increasingly positive dialogue about blockchain technology.However, he said the team's priorities now are to build a strong local team in Israel before investing the resources needed to bring on more marquee clients, concluding:""We'll need to be bigger, but we're still not there.""";Bitcoin/blockchain;http://www.coindesk.com/wave-blockchain-trade-finance-barclays/
31;"The Q3 2015 report marks CoinDesk's eighth in the series and much has changed since we released the first State of Bitcoin in February 2014. Arguably the most significant change, which was highlighted in last quarter’s report, has been the dramatic shift in focus from bitcoin’s use as an alternative currency and store of value to the possibilities surrounding the underlying distributed ledger technology, or blockchain.There has long been significant interest in the many different uses for blockchain technology. However, the ‘non-currency’ use cases (eg securities settlement) have, until recently, generally commanded less total mindshare than ‘currency’ use-cases (eg merchant acceptance and payment processing).In acknowledgment of the increasing emphasis placed on distributed ledger technology, we have retitled our report the ‘State of Bitcoin and Blockchain’ and added a new section specifically focused on the latest developments in distributed ledger technology.Bitcoin startups pivotAlongside the interest shown during Q3 in distributed ledger tech by traditional financial institutions (and the added competition this will bring), several bitcoin startups announced new blockchain initiatives. For instance, US exchange itBit revealed its bankchain product, and Ripple announced its Interledger initiative to connect various distributed ledgers.Indeed, with the reduction in exchange trading volume, and relatively slow pickup in areas such as payments and bitcoin remittance (Slide 55) it has been clear for some time now that many startups would either need to pivot or perish.In anticipation that more bitcoin companies will incorporate blockchain-oriented products and services we have created a new industry classification framework that distinguishes between three different business models: ‘currency’, ‘non-currency’ and ‘hybrid’ (Slide 65).‘Currency’ companies are wallets, exchanges, payment processors and other financial services companies that principally focus on bitcoin as an alternative payment rail or investment asset.In contrast, ‘non-currency’ companies focus on infrastructure and the use of blockchain technology for information management. Hybrids like itBit, which runs both a currency exchange as well its own blockchain product and service, combine both business models.Looking at the industry through this new framework shows that, to date, less than a third of all venture capital has been invested in blockchain startups (non-currency and hybrid)Bitcoin price volatility returnsAfter a relatively quiet Q2, bitcoin’s price once again made news, and over half of the top 10 most viewed stories on CoinDesk during Q3 were related to price (Slide 19).Bitcoin’s price spiked in the early part of Q3 due to macroeconomic concerns in Greece and China but then briefly fell below $200 in August, hitting a new six-month low.The return of price volatility coincided with a 17% quarter-over-quarter increase in bitcoin exchange trading volume (Slide 13). However, trading volumes still remain well below previous levels. State of Bitcoin Q2 2015Pace of VC investment slowsTotal bitcoin venture capital increased 11% to $921m in Q3. While all time bitcoin investment is on track to surpass $1bn in 2015, there has been a slowdown in the pace of investment (Slide 30).It is unclear at this stage if there is any particularly noteworthy reason behind the observed slowdown in investment; it may reflect something significant such as the venture capital community’s concerns over the speed of adoption, or something insignificant like seasonal factors.One positive investment development to note is that more traditional financial services firms are investing in the space. For example, in September payments giant Visa made its first publicly announced investment when it joined Chain’s $30m Series B, which, along with BitFury’s $20m Series C, were this quarter’s two biggest deals.Rising competition has also led to an increase in the number of acquisitions and bankruptcies, with consolidation particularly active in the exchange and mining sectors due to cost and competitive pressures (Slide 39). Consolidation - State of Bitcoin Q3 Shakeout in payment processor sectorPayment processor and wallet startups have seen little-to-zero venture capital investment over the last several quarters (Slide 37).Bitcoin’s failure to gain significant traction as a medium of exchange for non-illicit transactions is roiling the payment processing sector. For example, BitPay, which is one of the most well-financed startups in the space, announced significant staff cuts and that it will no longer offer its ‘free and unlimited’ introductory service to new merchants looking to accept bitcoin as payment.However, it is important to note that the challenges associated with the adoption of new payment methods are not unique to bitcoin. For example, Apple Pay has also struggled to sustain its early momentum and gain wider use despite the tremendous publicity surrounding the announcement of Apple Pay and success of the iPhone 6 (Slide 52).";Bitcoin/blockchain;http://www.coindesk.com/sob-q3-2015-banks-embrace-blockchain-amid-bitcoin-funding-slowdown/

33;A blockchain phenomenon is happening right in front of our eyes and it’s very hard not to marvel at the idea of being in the middle of the next big technological advancement.Blockchain and cryptocurrencies remind me of the euphoria that engulfed technology at the onset of Twitter and Facebook. We’re now seeing genuine acceptance from banks who are actively investing in the blockchain infrastructure. Just as in the Web 1.0 days, bitcoin and other pioneer cryptos may not survive the increasing evolution of blockchain, but blockchain as a technology is here to stay. To put everything into context, here are some details:1.Citigroup has been looking at distributed ledger technology for the last few years and has amassed a skilled team that has constructed three blockchains and a test currency to run across them. By operating like a venture capital funder in the fintech space, Citi is able to achieve better results by speeding its capital injection capacity. (This is one area that had previously slowed down a banking innovation.)2.LHV Bank is creating a financial services platform and money-transfer app that will utilize bitcoin to facilitate transactions, which will include an experimental bitcoin-based certificate of deposit.3.UBS has now opened up a blockchain research lab in London with the aim of experimenting with how blockchain can be adapted to process a wide range of financial transactions in a more efficient and cost-effective way.4.Santander is currently experimenting with blockchain and digital currencies through its Crypto 2.0 team. InnoVentures, which has a $100m (£64m) fintech investment fund, has already funded three deals, with two more two pending. One of the funded startups is working on blockchain technology.5.Nasdaq has confirmed that it will be using blockchain technology from US startup Chain to underpin its new private share-trading market.6.Singapore Central Bank is funding a blockchain record-keeping project.7.ING, ABN Amro and Rabobank have been experimenting on blockchain since 2014.And the list keeps growing. The attraction to blockchain is easy to understand, since the modern financial system wasn’t designed for the digital age and has a lot of legacy issues.A distributed ledger is a network that records ownership through a shared registry. Image: FTIs this the beginning of an internet of finance? The blockchain technology will fundamentally reduce costs and provide real-time service, so will banks insist on making it centralized? And will this run counter to the concept of blockchain?While Twitter and Facebook have been credited with triggering the Arab revolution, it’s not bullish to predict that blockchain will revolutionize the current financial system.;Bitcoin/blockchain;http://banknxt.com/52000/proliferation-of-blockchain-technology/
34;The UK Financial Conduct Authority has opened its doors to blockchain technology, and banks are now rapidly advancing research in this area.The financial crisis has driven the rapid development of alternative financial services models, the most revolutionary being the blockchain. This technology has the potential to fundamentally reshape the financial services industry and will have a much wider impact than bitcoins alone. For example, UK-based fintech startup firms such as Everledger and Coinsilium are already utilizing blockchain technology to create a transparent, immutable, secure global ledger for trade.The UK government is exploring the use of blockchain technology to improve the transparency and accuracy of its own recordkeeping, with the Bank of England seeking to create ‘hybrid systems’ using blockchain technology. The Financial Conduct Authority is also supporting those developing new-use cases by helping them navigate regulatory requirements, and identifying areas where the regulatory system could benefit from the new technology.And now a number of banks in the UK and beyond are investigating ways in which blockchain technology can be used to overhaul their operating models. Barclays for example is running two labs or workspaces dedicated to blockchain innovation. Deutsche Bank is also exploring the potential commercial application of distributed ledgers in areas such as Know Your Customer processes. Banks are now viewing the technology underpinning digital currencies as an opportunity rather than an external threat.Blockchain’s potential value to the UK is much greater than payments alone. In order for the UK economy to benefit from the emerging capabilities of the technology, the ability to move from concept to trial in a safe and cost-effective manner is critical.;Bitcoin/blockchain;http://banknxt.com/53505/blockchain-technology/

36;Blocktrail Creates Bitcoin Wallet Demonstrating Independent Financial Control  BlockTrail, an Amsterdam-based Bitcoin company, jumped on the bandwagon by releasing its own version of the Bitcoin wallet. According to BlockTrail CEO, Boaz Bechar, the thing that separates the BlockTrail wallet from numerous competitors is higher security.“The whole reason why people get into Bitcoin is to no longer be dependent on a bank,” says BlockTrail CTO, Ruben de Vries. “The motto that I like about Bitcoin is ‘be your own bank’. You don’t want to be part of a financial system that keeps you hostage when they own your funds.”Using what’s called multi-signature wallets, BlockTrail allows users higher levels of privacy and security. Multi-signature wallets demand more than one private key for Bitcoin transactions, thus allowing access for different individuals, but necessitating 2 or more of the users to log off before the transaction can be set underway. Besides that, BlockTrail vouches that users’ private keys will be in their own control, leaving the company unable to use the account or access the Bitcoins, unless the coin holders themselves sign off. This protects users from a myriad of problems, and allows them to retrieve their bitcoins even if BlockTrail encounters security breaches or even gets liquidated.“In the case of Bitcoin you don’t even need to trust us, so if we were to disappear… people still own their Bitcoins. We cannot run away with their Bitcoins. And they could still use the app and restore their wallets even without us, which is really what makes us special,” Boaz Bechar points out. The platform plays off of the decentralization that is characteristic of Bitcoin and demonstrates how consumers desire autonomy while interacting with financial services in general.BlockTrail wallet is a multi-platform service available on iOS, Android, and the web, facilitating all the services you are accustomed to in Bitcoin wallets: transferring and storing coins and payments securely, as well as receipting using QR codes.;Bitcoin/blockchain;http://www.brandingmagazine.com/2015/09/25/blocktrail-creates-bitcoin-wallet-demonstrates-changing-financial-behaviors/
37;"“More men and women have gone to space than there are developers that know how the blockchain works.”That’s not exactly a compliment, nor is it a vote of confidence based on the number of people who’ve traveled into space.At the Finovate Fall 2015 FinTech conference last week in NYC, when demoing its blockchain solution, the crew at Blockstack uttered those words as a reminder as to why the blockchain and bitcoin haven’t gone mainstream yet — and why those FinTech innovations might be a ways off from making their way into the everyday financial ecosystem.Of course, that hasn’t stopped Wall Street from dabbling with the concept of the blockchain as a way to change how money moves from point A to point B, and it hasn’t stopped big organizations, like Visa and Barclays, from throwing their weight behind it either.But outside the financially tech-savvy innovators with deep pockets to toss more funds toward research into the potential of the blockchain, there’s still a slew of startups trying to make a name for themselves in the market. And to do so, they’ve got to have a niche.Bitcoin for beginners.That’s how ArcBit pitches its bitcoin wallet that just hit the market three months ago.ArcBit CEO and Founder Timothy Lee sat down with PYMNTS during Finovate to share more about how ArcBit’s simple interface provides a more secure and more streamlined way for consumers to store and use their bitcoins.First, it starts with security.ArcBit gives its users full control over their bitcoins; the company never has access to the funds. In the case of most bitcoin wallets, even those that are encrypted have some access to the bitcoins. And we all know how important security is for bitcoin users (take the Mt. Gox mess, for example).“The problem with Mt. Gox is back in the early days of bitcoin. It was very difficult to secure your [bitcoin] wallet back then. The technology was very early days,” Lee explained. “Nowadays, bitcoin technology has evolved a lot. So, the backup of recovering the process of bitcoins got a lot easier.”But making bitcoin easier to use doesn’t mean the mainstream is ready to adopt it. Lee fully understands this, and that’s why he’s using ArcBit to appeal to consumers who are already into bitcoin before he branches out to the true bitcoin beginners. Still, he’s hopeful that the moves on Wall Street can push the blockchain mission forward.This, he noted, can’t be done without talking about the one name that some blockchain enthusiasts believe is holding the digital currency innovation back: bitcoin. “I think blockchain has entered mainstream in the financial industry. They just don’t talk about bitcoin. But what they don’t know is that they are tied together. You can’t separate the two,” Lee said. “I think it will take a lot longer for the mainstream adoption of bitcoin. I’m seeing more five to 10 years, because the current state of bitcoin is very much like it was back with the Internet back in the 1990s. People didn’t know about it; only techies knew how to use it, and it was very sticky. But we’re moving very fast. And over five to 10 years, we can get mainstream adoption.”Where Lee really sees a use case for bitcoin and bitcoin wallets are in areas where banking systems aren’t as prevalent but smartphones are. Or places like Argentina and Venezuela that have high inflation rates. Skipping the banks and embracing bitcoins and digital payments on smartphones could be one way to leapfrog the blockchain technology into the mainstream.So how can a company like ArcBit and its “bitcoin for beginners” philosophy help innovate the financial ecosystem? By reminding consumers the use cases for bitcoin and how, when and where it can serve a purpose. And most of all, how it can enhance financial transaction security.“Because ArcBit uses bitcoin, it’s borderless. You can send money to anyone, anywhere with a minimum fee. And people have control over their own money. There’s no third-party risk. People can’t see your money because you have control over it.”Whether one is a bitcoin expert or a bitcoin novice, having control and peace of mind over where those bitcoins are is probably what matters most for getting consumers to buy into bitcoin. Especially the heavily regulated, mainstream financial players";Bitcoin/blockchain;http://www.pymnts.com/in-depth/2015/innovating-bitcoin-with-bitcoin-for-beginners/
38;Another day, another potential use case for the blockchain. This time, Chroma Fund wants to use the ledger technology as a means to link startups with crowdfunded investments – though not as one might think of at the first thought of “crowdfunding.”Reports in TechRepublic Tuesday (Oct. 20) outlined the vision for Chroma Fund to use the metadata that can be found within the blockchain to organize how company shares can be traded and sold.It’s the ability for the blockchain to provide authentication of data and information that sits at the center of the Chroma Fund idea.“There is a massive shift in what it means to raise capital and how we think about the idea of investing,” said Mike Merrill, the company’s co-founder. “We’re pushing up against it and I know it’s going to start slow. But once we build up momentum this will be ‘the way things work.’”The company allows investors to acquire shares of a company in the form of share certificates based on the blockchain, reports said. Those digital certificates are certified by the blockchain technology, making them as valuable as physical items, the TechRepublic article explained.This makes trading these shares more secure and does so through a more trustworthy process. The digital share “is the sacred object that proves your ownership and validates your investment,” explained the firm’s other co-founder Marcus Estes.Like so many working with blockchain technology today, Chroma Fund is not depending on the success of bitcoin for the company to take off.“We didn’t presume only bitcoin people would want to use [Chroma Fund] as a crowdfunding tool,” said Estes. “It’s a complicated protocol, but we wanted normal people to understand why they should use Chroma to fund projects.”According to reports, Chroma Fund only operates in Oregon, as private investors need to be authorized to buy shares. But the company said the JOBS Act helped the company progress, “because it means we can focus on the tech and on the product, rather than waste time figuring out the bureaucracy,” Estes said. The company said it expects changes in national rules that will allow Chroma Fund to open across the country.;Bitcoin/blockchain;http://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2015/startup-envisions-crowdfunding-via-blockchain/
39;The terms “blockchain” and “bitcoin” often go hand-in-hand. After all, the bitcoin digital currency was developed to operate over blockchain ledger technology. But as more financial institutions take a look at the potential of these innovations, industry players seem more interested in how blockchain can lead to faster global payments — whether a payment is done with bitcoin or not.New research from Greenwich Associates seems to confirm this concept. Reports by CoinDesk published Tuesday (Oct. 6) say nearly three-quarters of financial industry experts agree that blockchain technology can take off and thrive, even if bitcoin doesn’t.According to reports, Greenwich Associates found that 73 percent of FinServ experts agreed that the blockchain is not dependent on bitcoin to impact the market. The results were summarized in a new report, “Distributed Ledgers in Capital Markets: Answering the Big Questions.”Additional findings conclude that nearly one-third (32 percent) believe that legal and compliance officials will trust payments made via the blockchain, and an additional 38 percent said that they believe these personnel will “eventually” trust the technology.Thirteen percent of those surveyed said that “more regulation is needed” before regulators and compliance officials can establish trust in payments via blockchain. About one-tenth, however, said that this trust is unlikely to ever take shape in the market.“For the blockchain or another distributed ledger to provide this clarity to the market, market participants and the legal system would all have to recognize the ledger as the golden copy of who owns what,” the report concluded. “This is technically possible but not a reality just yet.”Regardless, the industry seems to think that should the blockchain take off as an accepted technology in payments, bitcoin doesn’t need to be a part of the equation — except for those with a background in bitcoin.“This result doesn’t scream controversial,” the report said. “But while capital markets professionals (who make up most of our sample) are convinced, those with backgrounds in bitcoin and the blockchain are not.”;Bitcoin/blockchain;http://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2015/blockchain-without-the-bitcoin/

41;"National Australia Bank and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia will be taking part in a joint project led by global financial innovation firm R3 to design protocols based on blockchain technology at the same time as the ACCC has begun investigating the banks for closing the accounts of Bitcoin businesses last month.Australia’s two of the largest banks, National Australia Bank and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, will join R3, which includes 20 other major banking groups including HSBC and Citigroup, to explore the underlying technology of bitcoin and its uses to optimize and improve settlements and overall banking operations.NAB and Commonwealth BankThe news comes after the decision by the two banks to close all accounts associated with bitcoin startups and projects because according to the banks, all bitcoin startups failed to comply with KYC (know your customer) and AML (anti money laundering) policies. All major banks of Australia abruptly shut down accounts of bitcoin companies without any prior notice on the same day.The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has already begun their investigations to find out the reason behind the banks’ collaborate decision. ACCC chairman Rod Sims told the Australian Financial Review the investigations are in the early stages and the organization has asked the banks to explain their actions.""It is being investigated. We have already spoken to some banking representatives and sought some information. It is all still early stage, but under way,"" said Sims. ""We are asking the banks why they acted as they did and what contact there was between them.""The investigation by the ACCC was requested by Australian senator Matthew Canavan, who suspects the banks have decided to proceed with the closing of all accounts associated with bitcoin because they wanted to avoid competing with emerging companies.Canavan said:""We have strong laws against one business obstructing another business competing against it. These laws are even tougher for those companies that have the privileged position of a significant market share.""While the ACCC has already started interviewing the banks and financial institutions involved, it will take around a couple of months for the ACCC to conclude the investigation. Until then, all bitcoin related businesses will not be able to use their bank accounts to transact with its customers and partners.";Bitcoin/blockchain;http://cointelegraph.com/news/115429/australian-banks-ride-the-blockchain-after-pushing-out-bitcoin-companies
42;Coinbase, founded in June 2012, is a bitcoin wallet and exchange company located in San Francisco, California. Founded by Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam, Coinbase allows people to exchange bitcoin for fiat currencies and vice versa – and has received $106 million in VC funding to date. Coinbase just announced that it now operates in 26 countries, where customers can instantly buy bitcoin. While this capability represents but a step in the direction toward easier accessibility to digital currency markets, it is a positive development for the industry. Most experts recognize that every positive development that increases public awareness of and access to cryptocurrency brings the world one step closer to full acceptance of currencies such as Bitcoin and DNotes.Beginning in October 2012, customers could convert their fiat money into Coinbase through a bank transfer that required them to enter their bank information. Coinbase received a first round of funding of $5 million, and by 2014 the company’s customer base had grown to 1 million users. Coinbase also formed business partnerships with Overstock, Dell, Expedia, Dish Network, Time Inc., and Wikipedia to empower those companies to start accepting bitcoin payments.Coinbase then was able to add bitcoin payment processing capabilities for companies like Stripe, Braintree, and PayPal. Later in January 2015, Coinbase received more funding – this time $75 million – which included investments from the New York Stock Exchange, creating enormous buzz at the time. Other investors included several banks and USAA. Later that month, the company created even more buzz by launching a bitcoin exchange based out of the U.S.Now Coinbase supports 3D Secure credit and debit cards, which free customers from the need to pre-fund their Coinbase accounts through bank transfers. This allows customers to receive bitcoin a lot more quickly. The Visa 3D protocol that forces customers to validate their identity by punching in a password is now used by most banks in Europe. This new system is quicker and more convenient than the former process, though it does still entail a 3% fee per transaction. According to Coinbase’s website, no other cards besides Visa, Mastercard, and Maestro can be accepted at this time, and all purchases must be at least £1. Customers located in Liechtenstein and Slovenia are now able to buy and sell on the platform, but they are still not able to use the instant functionality and have to rely on SEPA transfers instead. Coinbase’s current mission is to expand its services to even more countries, and the company has plans to service a total of 30 countries by 2016. Obviously, that still represents but a fraction of the world’s countries, but the trend toward broader access remains an encouraging development as digital currency continues to work to gain the world’s trust and acceptance.;Bitcoin/blockchain;http://dcebrief.com/coinbase-provides-26-countries-opportunity-to-buy-bitcoin-instantly/
43;"BitPay has reduced the size of its staff in an effort to ""reduce costs"" and ""better align with the pace of growth"" in the industry, according to an email sent by CEO Stephen Pair to the firm's employees earlier today.The confirmation of staff reductions at the troubled bitcoin payments processor follows speculation, rumors and a report by bitcoin news source Qntra that BitPay employees were seen leaving its Atlanta office following layoffs.Pair's email, entitled ""Important Company Announcement"" and sent to the entire company, suggests the move may have been taken with little prior notice to employees, as he indicated his belief the day would be ""emotional"" for those involved. The email was provided to CoinDesk by a source close to the firm.Sources close to the company suggest upwards of 20 full-time employees and contractors may have been laid off.The email reads:""I urge everyone to be professional and considerate and not allow the emotion of the day to get the better of you. It saddens me to have to deliver this news as it has been an honor to get to know each and every one of you and my privilege to work with you. And I know [executive chairman] Tony [Gallippi] feels the same way.""Pair continued the email by suggesting employees affected by the staff reduction would be provided support during their job search, and that they would receive references from the company. Sources suggest some are already meeting with other industry employers.In statements, Pair sought to emphasize that the company has recently set ""new all-time high monthly transaction volumes"", a development he suggests positions it for long-term success.Pair said:""The road to building a successful company is full of challenges.

The pricing structure contrasts with rival Coinbase, which charges 0% processing fees on the first $1m its merchant clients transact.BitPay has so far raised $32.5m through three funding rounds and boasts investors including AME Cloud Ventures, Founders Fund, RRE Ventures and angel investors including Ashton Kutcher, Ben Davenport and Roger Ver.";Bitcoin/blockchain;http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-processor-bitpay-reduces-staff-in-cost-cutting-effort/
44;Point-of-sale (POS) solutions giant Ingenico is expanding its scope of bitcoin payments support thanks to a partnership with BitPay.Join Our Bloggers CommunityApplyParis-based Ingenico’s terminals are among the most commonly used among merchants worldwide. Every merchant using Ingenico’s Telium system will now have the ability to turn on bitcoin payments after installing the BitPay app and opening a BitPay account. Upon checkout, a QR code is generated and scanned for the deposit of bitcoins, which are paid via the shopper’s mobile device.ADVERTISINGIngenico began supporting bitcoin earlier this year through a partnership with Paymium, a bitcoin payment processor, also based in France. That integration reportedly enabled bitcoin acceptance on POS terminals in Europe. The latest brings bitcoin to brick-and-mortar shops working with the Telium platform worldwide, in addition to the BitPay-supported merchants already using an Ingenico terminal.Traditionally, it has been easier for e-commerce stores to accept bitcoin, and by extension, partnerships making it possible for thousands of online shops to accept bitcoin in one fell swoop have been more common. The expansion to brick-and-mortar stores can, in theory, have a meaningful impact upon overall bitcoin usage, although such integrations have seemingly failed to achieve this vision in the past.Previously, Ingenico was reportedly involved in a project led by the Canadian government to develop a government-backed p2p digital cash. The government divested from the project last year, its eventual fate unclear, although the general concept of government-backed p2p cash has since been revived elsewhere in 2015.For BitPay, the announcement is a slight boost during a time of unmet expectations for bitcoin usage. Recently, the household name shed a significant portion of its workforce.;Bitcoin/blockchain;http://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/ingenico-partners-with-bitpay-to-enable-bitcoin-for-pos-terminals-worldwide/

However, it would not use bitcoin to trade gold.""It is a proprietary itBit protocol, not blockchain based, but is derived off of blockchain. We will also not be using bitcoin as the native token it will be an itBit proprietary token."" Steve Wager, head of global operations for itBit told CoinDesk. It needs to be mentioned here that itBit is the only bitcoin exchange in New York with a banking charter, which will allow the company to help its customers settle their transactions in U.S. dollars. Bitcoin loyalists, however, are not much in favour of a blockchain-inspired technology that is privately owned. Commenting on the CoinDesk report, one reader said, “What good is a private consensus-based ledger system; if it is private and closed source, it can be manipulated by whoever owns it”, while another called it a “marketing gimmick,” arguing that itBit is “running a private database and they use a bunch of buzzwords to try to make it look like a new technology.”Fortune said, “The bitcoin enthusiasts argue that itBit misunderstands what makes the blockchain a useful technology, but in reality they misunderstand why such a technology would be useful for an opaque market in which trillions of dollars in gold changes hands, figuratively speaking, each year...Whether or not Bankchain will be a success remains to be seen.”Read more at http://www.econotimes.com/itBit-to-launch-clearing-and-settlement-network-for-gold-market-100869#1e6Cb95wzYzdyxmJ.99";Bitcoin/blockchain;http://www.econotimes.com/itBit-to-launch-clearing-and-settlement-network-for-gold-market-100869
46;NeuCoin is a virtual currency that has been in development for quite some time. Originally announced by the launch of the whitepaper in February of 2015, the NeuCoin team unveiled their plan of battle for the future. Core values include convenience, not requiring upfront investments to get acquainted with the currency, and a large focus on microtransactions. The long wait is finally over, as NeuCoin has officially launched today. The NeuCoin Project Focuses On Many Different AspectsBitcoinist_NeuCoin_AspectsOver the course of most recent years, virtual currencies such as Bitcoin have become synonymous with certain aspects of finance, including online gambling, donations, and remittance. But all of those individual aspects are only a minor representation of the total scope in which virtual currency could play a major beneficial role. NeuCoin’s founding team started the NeuCoin project in March 2014 and set out to conquer all of these different aspects with their own type of virtual currency. Keeping in mind the founding team is made up of individuals who have been involved in sectors such as online gaming, shopping, and music, the NeuCoin project seems to have all of its ducks in a row from the start. Truth be told, NeuCoin wants to bring a tangible form of consumer utility, and not just focus on the financial aspect of using currency. Over the next few months, a pilot micropayments platform will be rolled out with major premium content partners in the gaming, music, and video industry. Additionally, NeuCoin has the support of three non-profit organizations based in the Isle of Man, to ensure future development, utility, and innovation. To make NeuCoin as convenient as possible, the team has opted for a gamified approach to this alternate virtual currency. All of the necessary tools will be packaged into one easy-to-use platform, including a web wallet and mining service. Comparing NeuCoin to “just another blockchain” would be vastly underestimating the coin’s potential, as the team is bringing a whole ecosystem of services from day one.Microtransactions are a major factor for the NeuCoin currency, regardless of the transaction amount. Whether you want to pay one cent or one dollar, NeuCoin will accommodate for every need in-app, online, and by serving as a payment method for premium content. Mobile and online games are at the top of the priority list, and dedicated releases will follow within the first few months after the launch. NeuCoin co-founder Dan Kaufman stated: “After a year and a half of hard work, we’re excited to finally see NeuCoin come alive. We can’t wait for the crypto community to see how this technology can be made easy and fun for regular people – the MyNeuCoin wallet, the Growth Accounts that let everyone be part of mining, and very soon GetNeuCoin that explains crypto to regular people and gives them a few coins for free.”Online Wallet, Coin-Earning Deposits, and Games & FunBitcoinist_NeuCoin_Growth AccountsThere are three main components to the NeuCoin launch, each of which will focus on a different market within the ecosystem. MyNeuCoin, the online wallet for NeuCoin, can best be described as a combination of Coinbase and Blockchain.info. No user coins are being held in MyNeuCoin directly, as there is no access to private keys associated with the wallet addresses. To make the whole MyNeuCoin experience as user-friendly as possible, users of the service can login by providing an email address and password. The whole experience will feel as if they are using an online “account” while they are simply using a web interface for their regular wallet. All of the information present in MyNeuCoin is derived from the NeuCoin blockchain directly. Storing, sending, and receiving NeuCoins is not the only objective for this alternate virtual currency, though. Growth accounts, which are equivalent to a proof-of-stake mining pool in the Bitcoin ecosystem, give users the chance to transfer funds to long-term accounts and earn large NeuCoin rewards during this period. All of these coins transferred to these growth accounts are contributing to the NeuCoin proof-of-stake mining pool and help secure the coin’s network. Regular consumers can actively participate in NeuCoin mining, without having to invest in hardware, or being required to have a technical background. The NeuProject team hopes to convert most of NeuCoin’s users into long-term supporters of the currency. Last but not last, there is some time for fun and games in the NeuCoin ecosystem as well. GetNeuCoin is the first of many onboarding websites to let mainstream consumers earn NeuCoin in an educational and fun environment. What makes GetNeuCoin so interesting is how the team wants to market this platform to non-crypto users first and foremost and combine it with a referral program. Dan Kaufman, NeuCoin co-founder, shares his vision as follows: “Imagine… a random guy who knows nothing about crypto happens to win some ‘NeuCoins’ by playing a Facebook game. One click later and he’s on MyNeuCoin, which looks like a cool payment app like Venmo. One more click and his coins are “growing” (they’re actually mining but he doesn’t need to know that). Then he uses a few coins in another game to buy a power-up. A lot better than paying $5 with iTunes! Next he challenges his friend to the game, and they both get coins. That’s how you reach a million users, fast.”Creating a Whole Ecosystem, Rather Than An Altcoin or BlockchainBitcoinist_NeuCoin_TippyWhile all of these initiatives are designed to give NeuCoin a boost in the beginning, the NeuProject team is looking to the future as well. Games, tipping solutions and premium content – including pay-per-views and micro-subscriptions – will be made available in the coming months. To get a detailed grasp of how NeuCoin envisions the future of microtransactions, make sure to check out the Strategic Plan. The NeuProject team is looking to achieve much more than roll out “just another altcoin”. There are plans in motion to bring a whole new type of ecosystem to both mainstream consumers and virtual currency enthusiasts. In the end, the goal is to make NeuCoin more accountable and decentralized than “competitors” such as Ripple, Stellar, or even Bitcoin. ;Bitcoin/blockchain;http://insidebitcoins.com/news/neucoin-not-just-another-blockchain-but-a-complete-virtual-currency-ecosystem/34974
47;"Bitcoin has prompted many people to expect a revolution in the means by which we make and settle everyday payments. Our view is that Bitcoin and other ""virtual currency schemes"" (VCS) lack critical features of money, so their use is likely to remain very limited.In contrast, the technology used to record Bitcoin ownership and transactions -- the block chain -- has potentially broad applications in supporting payments in any currency. The block chain can be thought of as an ever-growing public ledger of transactions that is encrypted and distributed over a network of computers. Even as the Bitcoin frenzy subsides, the block chain has attracted attention from bank and nonbank intermediaries looking for ways to economize on payments costs. Only extensive experimentation will determine whether there are large benefits. Again, however, we are somewhat skeptical. Today's wholesale payments systems are so efficient that it is hard to see how or why one would make the costly and time-consuming effort to replace them. And the apparently high costs of retail transfers at least partly reflect factors that the block chain technology is unlikely to address.What made Bitcoin seem so attractive? Partly, we suspect, it is simple enthusiasm for the new and unexplored. Even today, Bitcoin lacks a single definition. One source describes it as an ""online communication protocol that facilitates the use of a virtual currency"" (see here), while another calls it ""a decentralized peer-to-peer network that allows for the proof and transfer of ownership without the need for a trusted third party"" (Schneider and Borra, The Future of Finance, Goldman Sachs, March 10, 2015). More importantly, advocates of Bitcoin (and other virtual currencies) view it as a new form of digital money whose value cannot be undermined by government fiat (since it is created and controlled by the network of users and a set of rules, rather than by a government) and whose users can remain anonymous while making payments electronically and efficiently. Bitcoin enthusiasts harken back to Hayek, who famously called for competition among currencies to promote both monetary and economic stability. However, Bitcoin lacks the key characteristics of money: namely, a commonly accepted means of exchange, a stable store of value, and a reliable unit of account. In no country is Bitcoin widely used as a direct means of payment (let alone recognized as legal tender); in some it is severely restricted or treated as a commodity subject to capital gains taxation. As a result, Bitcoin accounts for less than 70 thousand daily transactions globally (see here), compared to more than 250 million daily noncash transactions in the European Union and more than 500 million in the United States. In addition, Bitcoin's value is extremely unstable: the dollar value of a single Bitcoin surged from just pennies in 2010 to nearly $1150 at the peak in 2013 before plunging back below $300 in 2015 (see the chart below). Since 2012, the daily percentage change in Bitcoin's U.S. dollar value has ranged between -31 percent and +42 percent, with the standard deviation exceeding 5 percent! Had Bitcoin been employed as a unit of account over this period, all other prices would have been subject both to enormous day-to-day swings and to extraordinary episodes of inflation and deflation";Bitcoin/blockchain;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stephen-g-cecchetti/virtual-frenzies-bitcoin_b_8228444.html
48;"Physical bitcoins (Wikimedia, Mike Cauldwell) (Wikimedia, Mike Cauldwell) Bitcoin, a peer-to-peer digital currency, operates without the involvement of traditional financial institutions and provides a direct digital alternative to physical currencies and commodities. Governments worldwide generally do not yet see it and other digital currencies as a destabilizing “threat,” and some scholars have argued that it may best be seen as a speculative investment. Bitcoin has certainly had its ups and downs: As of April 1, 2015, its value stood at $242 per bitcoin, after a Jan. 14 low of $177 and a March 11 high of $296.The currency has also had a long run of troubles with hackers and fraud, most spectacularly in 2014 when the exchange Mt. Gox declared bankruptcy after bitcoins worth $460 million at the time were apparently stolen. Bitcoin’s decentralized model and degree of anonymity have also raised concerns over its use in illegal money transfers, fueling potential illicit commerce across the “dark web” and on sites such as Silk Road.The organization Bitcoin.org, meanwhile, touts the currency’s potential for opening up a “whole new platform for innovation”:Basic truths about Bitcoin can be hard to discern amid the hype and turmoil, but a 2015 Congressional Research Service (CRS) report, “Bitcoin: Questions, Answers and Analysis of Legal Issues,” provides key background information as well as an overview of major issues.Bitcoin transactions take place online directly between the buyer and seller, with each having a unique encryption. Transactions are recorded on a decentralized public ledger available for network users to verify valid transactions. Special users on the network (“miners”) oversee this verification process. After verifying a block of transactions, miners are paid with 25 newly generated bitcoins and the transactions are processed and approved; this is how the total number of bitcoins grows. The number in circulation as of January 2015 was approximately 13.7 million, with the maximum set at 21 million. As of April 2015, their total value was $3 to $4 billion. This relatively small figure prevents bitcoins from having a significant effect on the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy (an argument that is frequently, and incorrectly, brought up as one of the dangers of Bitcoin).The CRS report explores the following technical, functional and legal issues:Bitcoin advantages:•Lower transaction costs: Because Bitcoin operates without a third-party intermediary, merchants are able to avoid the fees traditionally charged by payment systems such as credit cards.•The possibility of increased privacy: Bitcoin provides a heightened degree of privacy for purchases and transactions, though by the system’s nature, a complete list of all transactions is forever recorded to each user’s encrypted identity.•Protection from inflation: Since Bitcoin’s circulation is not linked to currency or government regulation, it is not subject to standard inflation. However, it more than makes up for this in volatility.Bitcoin disadvantages:•Severe price volatility: The value of a bitcoin is determined by supply and demand, and as a result, can fluctuate rapidly. The value was as high as $1,100 in December 2013, then hit a low of $177 in January 2015. This extreme fluctuation is more characteristic of a commodity than a currency.•Not legal tender: Debtors are not required to accept it, and without any formal backing other than the computer program to which it is linked, Bitcoin can be seen as an “unattractive vehicle” for holding and accumulating wealth.•Uncertain security from theft and fraud: While the counterfeiting of bitcoins is allegedly impossible, the system has at times found itself vulnerable to large security breaches and cyber-attacks. Most recently, Bitstamp, a large European Bitcoin exchange, lost 19,000 bitcoins (valued at about $5 million) in a digital security breach. This follows the massive problems with Mt. Gox in 2014 and the collapse of other exchanges in 2011.•Vulnerability of Bitcoin “wallets”: Purchased or mined bitcoins are stored in a digital wallet on the user’s computer or mobile device, and digital keys can be lost, damaged or stolen. Paper or offline storage is an option, but not always practiced.The CRS report notes that, given the powers articulated in the U.S. Constitution, specifically the authority “to coin money” and “regulate the value thereof,” the responsibility to oversee digital currency falls upon Congress. As of now, Congressional actions remain in the exploratory phase, with the Senate Finance Committee having only recently asked the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to review tax requirements and compliance risks. The tax code lacks clarity on how such currency should be treated: Is it digital currency, property, barter or foreign currency? Early concerns have focused more on tackling consumer protection issues than tax ambiguities, and as a result, the GAO recommended increased inclusion of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in questions related to Bitcoin.Federal banking regulators have yet to issue guidance or regulations governing how banks are to deal with bitcoins. In a February 2014 statement, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen said: “Bitcoin is a payment innovation that’s taking place outside the banking industry…. There’s no intersection at all, in any way, between Bitcoin and banks that the Federal Reserve has the ability to supervise and regulate.” (See a 2014 paper from the Federal Reserve on technical background and data analysis.) Some state financial authorities have taken steps to devise regulations, with New York’s Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) in the lead.According to the CRS report, other legal issues with Bitcoin include:•Counterfeiting criminal statutes: It is illegal to counterfeit both U.S. and foreign currency, but current monetary laws do not mention digital currency. Given that Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer transaction without any formal involvement by a regulatory body or a government, it is unclear if there is a role or responsibility for the U.S. legal system to intervene if counterfeiting occurred in such a situation.•Federal tax laws: To date, the IRS has done little to address the tax implications of virtual currencies. Instead, the IRS has focused on public education by issuing guidelines indicating that for now, virtual currency will be treated as property for tax purposes, and within that framework, all corresponding tax laws apply.•Federal anti-money laundering laws: To fight illegal and terrorist-related financial transactions, the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) requires financial institutions to keep records. This allows suspicious withdrawals and transactions to be tracked. These requirements would conceivably be placed on any business that engages in the exchange of bitcoins for U.S. or foreign currency.";Bitcoin/blockchain;http://journalistsresource.org/studies/society/internet/bitcoin-virtual-currencies-key-technical-legal-issues
49;"the search for riches in the ground has motivated some of history’s most extravagant endeavors. It has inspired explorers, enslaved populations, and put opera houses in dusty mountain towns. But when the boom ends, the miners themselves have often been left in the lurch. They handle the raw material, turn it from hard earth to something potentially of value. Fabulous wealth comes to only a few, who rarely hold onto it long enough to be considered lucky. The search for bitcoins is little different.--advertisement--The Bitcoin Center NYC, the self-described “center of the Bitcoin revolution,” inhabits a retail storefront on Manhattan’s Broad Street, a block from the New York Stock Exchange. The staff of an Asian-infused kosher steakhouse next door occasionally shoos loitering Bitcoiners from the sidewalk, indifferent to the revolution allegedly underway. Inside the Bitcoin Center, two small tables off to one side house a menagerie of Internet-age extraction equipment: Bitcoin mining machines. They resemble boxy desktop computers, only larger and without screens or keyboards attached. Only one of them, the CoinTerra TerraMiner IV, was in use during a visit I paid to the Center last November, emitting a purr of white noise. But the thing was still pretty much dead weight.The TerraMiner IV rests on the table horizontally, encased in black metal, with rack-mounts and two stainless steel grates on either end that look like the eyeholes of a deep-sea diver. The grates cover fans that cool its array of application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs—advanced chips that do little else but churn through the complex cryptographic math that processes transactions for Bitcoin, the world's most famous virtual currency system. In return for their calculations, miners earn payouts of new bitcoins from the network, plus transaction fees from users. Like its non-virtual namesake, mining cryptocurrencies can be lucrative. But this TerraMiner IV has little hope of reward.At just about a year old, the miner represents a particularly rapid and fateful instance of the obsolescence that awaits every gizmo that alights on the cutting edge. Because of competition from faster, sleeker models now on the network, it can no longer mine enough bitcoins to pay for the electricity it burns. Even the newest miners may no longer break even, as the value of a bitcoin continues its free fall from a high of over $1,100 in late 2013 to less than $250 today; the 25 bitcoins that the network spits out about every 10 minutes may not be worth the trouble it takes to earn them. CoinTerra, the TerraMiner IV's maker, filed for bankruptcy on January 24. Like a used-up gold mine, the machine lends even the Bitcoin Center's busiest evenings the sensation of a ghost town.   Nick Spanos founded the Bitcoin Center a few hours before New Year’s Eve in 2013. He is a New York City real estate broker who learned about Bitcoin “pretty early,” he says, at a libertarian meetup. He envisioned his storefront as a beachhead for Bitcoin in the heart of the Financial District, but it has been losing money as he waits for government agencies, such as New York's Department of Financial Services, to decide how to regulate virtual currencies. Plans to run an exchange there have been deferred, and the Bitcoin ATM on a wall near the miners remains offline—both victims of legal limbo. Spanos has been slowly selling off his miners, at a loss, for their educational value. Meanwhile, he has been running them in cooler months to heat the storefront.1“I feel like a martyr—a Bitcoin martyr,” he told me. “We're bleeding out.” But for anyone invested in a commodity whose value depends on confidence, spreading pessimism can be costly. Without much conviction, Spanos insisted that Bitcoin “is going to change the world.”";Bitcoin/blockchain;http://www.newrepublic.com/article/121089/how-small-bitcoin-miners-lose-crypto-currency-boom-bust-cycle
50;"Bitcoin was supposed to usher in a new, global economy—gold for the Internet age, managed not by a central authority but by infallible algorithms running on the computers of those who use it. The first converts were tech-savvy utopians, whose bitcoins went from being worth just cents to hundreds of dollars. A substantial industry of magazines and websites appeared in order to simultaneously report on and promote the new currency. A Bitcoin-based charity in Florida bought a nine-acre forest as a sanctuary for the homeless, and Wired deemed Bitcoin “the great equalizer” for its potential to put financial services in the hands of the (Internet-enabled) poor. It also attracted the interest of innovation-hungry investors like the Winklevoss twins, Mark Zuckerberg's old nemeses. Bill Gates called it “better than currency.” But  the Bitcoin revolution has begun to look more and more like the system it was intended to replace—except perhaps more centralized, less egalitarian, and even more clogged by unseemly interests.Mining, especially, was supposed to be an act of democracy. On the P2P Foundation’s online forum, Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto wrote, “The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work.” This was February 11, 2009—just as the financial giants were breaching the world's trust. At the time, only a month after Bitcoin’s initial “genesis block” went online, anyone could mine with an ordinary computer, though doing so was technically difficult and barely lucrative. These citizen-miners could choose which version of the software to run, thus voting on the future of the network. Mining, too, was more than a metaphor; Nakamoto designed Bitcoin to resemble gold in more ways than one—a finite supply, its value backed by its scarcity and the energy required to extract it.2This was unquestionably a breakthrough. For the first time, the technology underlying Bitcoin made possible a secure, decentralized, open-source financial network. Users wouldn’t have to trust an agency or authority, just the software. Rather than relying on a single institution's server, they shared access to the transactions listed on Bitcoin's digital ledger—the blockchain—which is now more than 50 million transactions long. They mined money out of thin air. Boosters announced that financial freedom would soon be at the fingertips of the previously under-banked, and people anywhere in the world could send money over the Internet with negligible overhead. “It takes advantage of the nature of information being easy to spread but hard to stifle,” Nakamoto prophesied in his P2P Foundation post. The old financial industry’s days were numbered. “Disruption” was on the lips of everyone in the know.As the value of bitcoins swelled against the dollar over the course of 2013, a mining arms race began. People realized that their computers’ graphics chips were better suited to Bitcoin's mining algorithms than standard CPUs, so they built specialized machines overloaded with graphics processors, which increased their chances of reaping a reward. Starting in the first months of that year, ASICs arrived—application-specific integrated circuits designed with the sole purpose of mining coins. Before long the lone miner with a regular computer was a lost cause, unable to compete with the new mining syndicates, or “pools,” and multi-million-dollar data centers in places around the world with the most profitable combination of cold weather and cheap electricity—45,000 miners in a Swedish helicopter hangar, for instance, or 20 million watts in the Republic of Georgia. Together Bitcoin's miners amount to hundreds of times more computing power than the combined output of the world’s top 500 supercomputers. Processing and protecting the more than $3 billion worth of bitcoins in circulation requires more than $100 million in electricity each year,3 generating a volume of carbon emissions to match.“From a technological perspective, the Bitcoin network is unprecedented,” says Dave Hudson, an analyst who blogs about mining at hashingit.com. “As far as I'm aware there's never been anything as big in the past.” All that computing power, which could be curing cancer or exploring the stars, is locked up in machines that do nothing but process Bitcoin-type transactions.The prospects for democracy in the system have grown dimmer still. By the middle of last year, the largest mining pools came within reach of a 50 percent market share—making it possible for them to endanger the whole system by falsifying transactions. What prevents them from actually doing so, apparently, is that it would reduce confidence in the value of the bitcoins they invest so much to mine. They also prevent changes to the Bitcoin software that would lessen their dominance. A distributed network of users now has to trust an oligarchy of capital-intensive miners.  Edwin Cuevas III is a 26-year-old airbrush artist who manages a Manhattan yogurt store, decorates cakes at a Carvel in Queens, and interns for Spanos at the Bitcoin Center. He sees in Bitcoin the democratic promise that first attracted many of the earliest adopters. “Where it’s going to be needed most is with people that are under-banked,” he told me. He wants to see it spread not just around Wall Street but back up in the Bronx, where he lives.--advertisement--Cuevas first learned about Bitcoin in late 2013, during the federal government shutdown, from a friend who was using it for “personal reasons.” The following January he came to the Bitcoin Center to learn more. He bought a toaster-sized, 30-gigahash-per-second Butterfly Labs miner for $350 in bitcoins during that first visit.4 A month later, he bought a Titan miner for $2,000. Cuevas admits that the miners have yet to earn back his investment, but they at least help heat his house. He stores whatever bitcoins they bring in for his five-year-old daughter’s education. He also earns a little extra by airbrushing cosmic starscapes on other people’s miners.A certain style of evangelistic piety prevails in the Bitcoin “space,” as participants in the burgeoning industry tend to call it. (From the “wallet” software used to manage accounts to the “coins” in virtual circulation, cryptocurrency jargon relies on the most physical of metaphors.) Optimism is the dominant idiom among enthusiasts, but it seems to rest less and less on any genuine belief than on an anxiety not to see their bitcoins further depreciate.“Some of the New York Bitcoin Center guys are pretty religious,” says Tim Swanson, who has written two e-books on cryptocurrencies in the past year, most recently The Anatomy of a Money-like Informational Commodity: A Study of Bitcoin. Before that, while living in China, he built his own graphics-chip miners. (Some of his miners have since been re-purposed as gaming systems.) Swanson has grown increasingly skeptical that Bitcoin will unsettle the existing finance megaliths. “You have centralization without the benefits of centralization,” he says. Bitcoin's promise of frictionless finance is drowning in the ever more immense cost of mining, user-friendly infrastructure, and appeasing regulators.“Being your own bank sounds cool in theory,” Swanson says, “but it’s a pain in reality.”Bitcoin, in any case, is only the beginning. Last June I went to the Bitcoin Center to hear a speech by Vitalik Buterin, a 20-year-old Russian-Canadian tech-prodigy. In one corner of the room that night, the notorious hacker-troll Weev, recently released from prison, was tinkering on a laptop. “Living off my bitcoins,” he told me, when I asked what he was up to. Attendees drifted around him eating pizza and sipping rum-and-Cokes.With a World Cup game projected silently above him, Buterin presented an update on his new project, Ethereum, a platform that proposes to take what Bitcoin does for money and do it for just about everything else. Rather than processing mere transactions, Ethereum will use a Bitcoin-like blockchain to process complex contracts written in code. It could be the seed of a truly decentralized, more secure replacement for the current web, and could even create entirely new forms of virtual citizenship, defined by data on a blockchain rather than borders or governments.Ethereum has raised more than $18 million in the second-largest crowdfunding campaign in history. The system has yet to go live, but it is already attracting attention from establishment powers. IBM researchers are using Ethereum code to develop an “Internet of things” platform for a new line of products. Eris Industries, an Ethereum-based project to enable radically decentralized decision-making (named after the Greek goddess of chaos), has pivoted to building internal networks for banks. And Blockstream, a Bitcoin company with goals comparable to Ethereum, has become a darling of Silicon Valley investors. Its founders boast an algorithm-enforced tweak on Google's motto: “Can't be evil.”Even as Bitcoin's dollar value declines, it still has the power to conjure utopian ambitions. A derivative of Bitcoin called FairCoin, for instance, is being turned into the basis of a globe-spanning cooperative. Developers in Israel are trying to build a blockchain-based, community-run alternative to Uber. For the most part, though, big business is catching up to Bitcoin’s Edens and remaking them in its image. At Bitcoin conferences nowadays, finance bros mingle with the libertarian survivalists. Ethereum is talked about less as a new world order than as just another killer app. “You have to be practical about what you're doing and not idealistic, because the idealistic doesn't get implemented,” says Preston Byrne, a founder of Eris.The next generation of miners is said to be on the way, too—faster and leaner than any that have come before. It’s another opportunity for consolidation, for greater economy of scale. One hears abut the great potential for Bitcoin expansion to poorer countries, where people need cheaper ways of sending money across borders. But starting in 2016 the network is expected to change how it dishes out rewards to miners, which will likely result in much higher transaction fees.“Distributed technologies do not necessarily lead to distributed outcomes,” writes Michel Bauwens, the Belgian-born founder of the P2P Foundation, which Satoshi Nakamoto turned to early on to promote his vision. Bauwens points out that the Bitcoin economy is more unequal than the conventional one. Currently, the top 100 users hold at least 20 percent of the wealth.Entrusting our money to algorithms, it turns out, is no guarantee of a better result than managing it with flawed institutions and flawed people. Perhaps we should be imagining tools that help us trust each other more, rather than entrusting ourselves to a rush for digital gold. The technology at work in Bitcoin can do this. It can be rearranged for cooperation rather than competition, for reputation rather than anonymity, for democracy rather than oligarchy. Some experiments along these lines, among the hundreds of “altcoins,” do away with intensive mining altogether. But unlike Bitcoin they're short on financing and evangelists. The allure of the machines makes it easy to forget that what we need is not a newer, slicker system but a better society.One recent evening at the Bitcoin Center, a middle-aged woman with a pearl necklace visible beneath her trenchcoat approached a shaggy-haired staffer standing next to the miners. She was from Harlem; the only name she cared to give was “Miss E.”“What is this Bitcoin?” she asked the staffer, who embarked on a long explanation of Bitcoin as a “layer” on the Internet for finance and of the cryptographic mechanics that kept secure. He was far from done when Miss E started to look like she was ready to leave.“I thought I would come in here and find someone who was gonna replace these banks,” she said, gesturing out the window to Broad Street. “We need to distribute the wealth, you know what I’m saying? I thought this was something for the small people.”";Bitcoin/blockchain;http://www.newrepublic.com/article/121089/how-small-bitcoin-miners-lose-crypto-currency-boom-bust-cycle
51;"The Financial and Consumer Affairs Authority (FCAA) of Saskatchewan, Canada, has cleared a bitcoin startup of breaching securities law.A decision from the FCAA panel, announced on 22nd October, found that Dominion Bitcoin Mining Company Ltd did not solicit investors, nor offer shares illegally. The decision follows a 17-month dispute over claims Dominion's founders – Jason Dearborn, Peter Voldeng and Ronald Gibbonthe – had offered securities from their website, dominionbitcoin.com.During a FCAA hearing, investigator Harvey White presented screenshots from the site, including a page that read: ""By taking part in our offering, you own a share in one of ten provincial companies that own Dominion. That share allows you an equal part in EVERY SINGLE BITCOIN WE EVER MINE.""ADVERTISEMENTAnother section of the website stated Dominion was accepting ""sophisticated"" investors from the 10 provinces that make up Canada.However, the respondents argued that their website was under construction at the time (they allege encrypted data was exposed following a hack) and did not accurately reflect the project's status. In fact, the corporations mentioned on the site did not yet exist – and there were no Dominion securities to sell.As a result, the founders were cleared. ""The Respondents had no clear picture of what an investor might be investing in,"" the FCAA's document reads.Future plansAt this point, little is known about Dominion beyond its name. ""We're expecting to actually develop the largest bitcoin mine in Canada,"" President Voldeng told CBC News last September, while plans to trade the currency are reportedly in the works.The company – whose domain is now disconnected – said it is unlikely to operate in Saskatchewan. Voldeng said it is also planning to sue the FCAA for libel.While Dominion has been cleared of all allegations, other bitcoin schemes have been revealed to be highly profitable scams.Last month, US resident Trendon Shavers plead guilty to securities fraud, having received approximately $4.5m while operating the Bitcoin Savings & Trust (BS&T).The organisation, which was investigated by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2013, promised investors 7% returns on bitcoin arbitrage in 2011 and 2012.";Bitcoin/blockchain;http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-startup-cleared-of-breaching-securities-law/

54;A tiny Regina bitcoin startup, Dominion Bitcoin Mining Co., says it has been “exonerated” after facing allegations from Saskatchewan’s securities regulator last year that it was soliciting investors without the proper paperwork.In a decision dated Oct. 22, a three-member panel of the province’s Financial and Consumer Affairs Authority (FCAA) ruled that no trading or other breaches of Saskatchewan’s Securities Act occurred. “It is the determination of the Panel that, notwithstanding the initially apparent validity of the allegations of the FCAA Staff, an offering of shares did not at material times exist, and the parties did not individually or collectively engage in any acts in furtherance of trading or in any breach of the provisions of the Act,” the decision reads.At issue were messages on Dominion’s website that appeared to urge “sophisticated investors” to buy shares in a group of companies engaged in what is known as bitcoin mining, which is the process by which computers are used to create new units of the virtual currency.“By taking part in our offering, you own a share in one of ten provincial companies that own Dominion. That share allows you an equal part in EVERY SINGLE BITCOIN WE EVER MINE,” the site read, according to the decision.At a hearing earlier this month, Dominion argued that the website was not live, and was supposed to be password-protected and encrypted, and was merely a “whiteboard” for the company’s ideas. They also say they had no securities to sell. The panel agreed that the fact the website was accessible was “unintended,” that no securities were ever sold or created, and that Dominion’s three founders “had no clear picture of what an investor might be investing in.”Jason Dearborn, a former Saskatchewan party MLA and a co-founder of the company, said he plans to sue the Saskatchewan regulator for libel for making the allegations. He also says he is pursuing other legal action for alleged violations of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms that he says took place during interviews with investigators. He also alleges his company’s website was accessible to investigators only because it had been hacked.“These guys are just absolutely ridiculous,” he said of Saskatchewan’s securities regulator. “ ... This is just a Mickey Mouse organization.”He said Dominion’s plans to mine bitcoins, and engage in bitcoin trading are still under development but that it would probably not do any business in Saskatchewan.However, he said the company has continued to mine bitcoin in the meantime. But Mr. Dearborn said Dominion had not sought out any external investors, and that it would operate in full compliance with securities laws.He also said an anonymous informant, labelled “Person X” in documents filed with the securities regulator, spurred the launch of the investigation while one of Dominion’s co-founders, Peter Voldeng, a former Saskatchewan Party president, was seeking his party’s nomination for a seat in the Saskatchewan legislature.;Bitcoin/blockchain;http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/the-law-page/regina-bitcoin-startup-exonerated/article26963085/

57;"Once again, blockchain technology is proving hard to ignore. Witness its prominence at the latest Sibos conference, recently concluded in Singapore.For those who don’t know, Sibos— Swift International Banking Operations Seminar—has the reputation of being the most intense and highly regarded global financial industry gathering. This year, 8,000 or so financial industry professionals—all in business, not business casual dress— traveled to Southeast Asia for four days of presentations, discussions, networking, new product expositions, and so forth.Quick disclosure: I did not attend this event. However, plenty of banking industry analysts did, and they were not shy about relating their experiences in their various blog posts:• “Sibos for a professional in the banking and financial industry is like an annual pilgrimage,” says Parvez Ahmad, marketing director for Oracle Financial Services Global Business Unit.• “Singapore hosted Sibos this year, and judging by the reported 8,000 attendees, transaction banking is alive and well,” says Dan Latimore, senior vice-president at Celent.• “The mood at Sibos was one of growing optimism and had a different feel to previous years. Regulation wasn’t the only topic being discussed, which normally is the case. Technology was the main topic of discussion,” says Rachel Fraser, marketing director for Oracle Financial Services.Blockchain comes to surface with “Hyperledger”This introduction leads directly to the influence that blockchain—generally described as “distributed ledger” technology and known initially as the backbone of cryptocurrencies—managed to wield at this event. Perhaps the most startling development related to this is the fact that a blockchain company called Hyperledger won the 2015 Innotribe Startup Challenge.This is a big deal. Innotribe is an annual global challenge to identify and reward—to the tune of $50,000—the most innovative and disruptive companies likely to have the biggest effect in the industry.Organized by SWIFT, more than 370 companies from around the world applied to this year’s startup challenge. A panel of more than 500 senior innovation executives at global financial institutions, venture capitalists, and angel investors selected 60 companies to participate in regional showcases in London, Cape Town, Singapore, and New York. These were narrowed down to a final 12 that were judged at Sibos.Lo and behold, Hyperledger won out. What is Hyperledger? As SWIFT describes, “Hyperledger is a distributed ledger platform tailored for regulated financial institutions to eliminate reconciliation costs, prevent trade breaks, and reduce settlement times and risk.”Celent’s Latimore came away from the Innotribe experience with the observation that Sibos indeed is changing and that technological innovation seems to be growing in importance—and by extension, that industry representatives are seeing financial technology in a whole new and more important light.“Sibos’ ambivalence about innovation manifested itself physically with Innotribe. The space was relatively small, and every time I went by I was unable to get in because it was filled to overflowing. Innovation clearly needs to be given even more attention despite the threats it presents to the existing structure. Was this perhaps a physical metaphor of banking’s relationship with and attitude towards fintech?” Latimore says.Oracle’s Ahmad has a similar view. “The good news is there is a growing realization that [banks] need to change, and nowhere was it felt more than in Sibos this year. The biggest reflection of this was the amazing response to Innotribe … which was usually like an aberration in Sibos. But this year it saw overflowing crowds, standing through sessions. The session on blockchain was a resounding hit.”Back to Latimore: “Two technology vendors I spoke to said that every single bank they met with asked about blockchain … While no one knows yet what the killer blockchain uses will be, banks are ramping up experiments along all facets of the value chain.”What’s the “killer blockchain app” going to be?So what may be the killer uses of blockchain in the banking industry?Hyperledger still is getting off the ground. Meanwhile, though, the U.S. blockchain provider Ripple is surging ahead with a number of strategic partnerships—which may shed some light on blockchain’s likely uses. In rapid succession in October, D+H Partners, CGI, and Volante Technologies Inc. announced relationships with Ripple:D+H: Will integrate its Global PAYplus payment services hub (formerly Fundtech) with Ripple’s distributed ledger technology. Accessible only with permission, it will allow the connection of interbank networks; movement of money domestically and across borders in real time; and allow access to cheaper liquidity through a distributed network of market makers.“Distributed ledgers have the potential to radically transform the payment process,” says Gene Neyer, head of product management, D+H. “They remove the frictional costs and reduce the complexities of using multiple intermediaries; reduce or eliminate the reconciliation processes; and transform and enrich existing business processes by providing alternative sources of liquidity.”CGI: Will team with Ripple to bring its distributed financial technology capabilities to the CGI payments solutions portfolio.“Together, we will provide banks with new infrastructure to settle cross-border and domestic transactions instantly, with complete end-to-end visibility and certainty, and at the lowest total cost available,” says Chris Larsen, Ripple CEO and cofounder.Volante Technologies: Created an interface between its VolPay suite of payment integration, processing, and orchestration products directly with Ripple’s distributed ledger capabilities.“We believe connectivity with Volante will help drive adoption of Ripple by providing banks a bridge from legacy standards to minimize costly core system changes,” says Ripple’s Larsen.And Ripple itself continues to explore possible applications. It just announced the availability of two solutions, one for cross-currency settlement and another for foreign exchange market making.Larsen, again: “We are encouraged by our partners’ positive reviews of Ripple during their pilots and by their eagerness to bring Ripple-powered services to their customers. But, we’ve only just begun. Through hundreds of conversations with financial institutions over the past two years, we’ve gleaned important feedback about what to develop next.”The biggest questionWhat’s next? That seems to be the critical question now for blockchain use in general.As Oracle’s Fraser remarks in her blog: “I came away from Sibos with a strong sense that technology will continue to dominate the banking landscape and that banks will need to exploit new technology to enable growth. What will be interesting to see is if the banks will adapt their business models to keep up with the changes. Blockchain was obviously the hot topic over the past four days. However, will this still be the case by the next Sibos? Only time will tell.”";Bitcoin/blockchain;http://www.bankingexchange.com/blogs-3/making-sense-of-it-all/item/5840-blockchain-next-big-thing
58;Credit card companies and banks are getting serious—or at least more curious—about the potential of bitcoin, making an increasing number of investments in startups involved with the digital currency.American Express late last week confirmed it participated in a $12 million Series A funding round for Abra, a service that makes it easier to send money between countries using the technology underlying bitcoin, called blockchain. Cross-border money transfers are viewed as an area where the technology could be particularly useful, given that conventional methods are costly and slow.The move by AmEx—its first investment in the digital currency—underscores how traditional financial institutions are at least taking initial steps toward understanding and incorporating bitcoin into some aspects of their business. However, they’re still wary about diving in headfirst, due to an unclear regulatory environment and a lack of mainstream interest.Blockchain startup Chain raised a $30 million Series B round last month, with big names like Visa, Nasdaq, and Citi taking part in the investment. Chain also partnered with Nasdaq for a pilot program in which private shares could be traded using blockchain technology. Another startup, R3CEV, has partnered with 22 of the biggest banks in the world, including Bank of America, Citi, BNY Mellon, Morgan Stanley, Barclays, BBVA, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan.

60;"Singapore-based digital assets company Digix and bitcoin payment processor Coinify are creating crypto-assets on Ethereum. The partnership marries the functionality of bitcoin with physical assets such as gold; diamonds are to be added soon, said the companies.Digix began on the Bitcoin blockchain using the coloured coin concept but felt the solution was not elegant as it requires the concept of ""burning"" bitcoins and a separate block explorer for looking at transaction history.Kai Cheng Chng, CEO and co-founder of Digix, told IBTimes UK: ""Basically, the longer the chain gets the slower the verification becomes because you have to scan the blockchain all the way to the original transaction. It's actually an exponential which you can't get around without having a centralised 'oracle' to store the transaction history.""We tried again on Counterparty, but also encountered several problems. Augur, another company built on Ethereum, has expressed similar concerns here as they went through similar issues like us.""Kai pointed out that using Ethereum transaction confirmations take on average between 14 to 17 seconds, as opposed to 10 minutes using the Bitcoin network. Also, solutions using Bitcoin technology are off chain, so you do not have the same level of security, and also this leads to a centralisation problem.Kai explained how the system worked: when people purchase gold with bitcoin they get to issue a certificate on the Ethereum blockchain. A process called the proof of asset protocol sees the documentation regarding the owner's gold bullion uploaded on to InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), and permanently affixed on the internet.The second layer of the protocol is where this file is hashed to get a fixed byte length. Each entity in a chain of custody would have to use their digital key to privately sign on the blockchain to acknowledge these certificates.'Minter smart contract'""That's where the blockchain technology comes in as well. Each of these entities from the supplier, the independent auditor, as well as the custodian would have to sign and make sure these documents are 100% accurate and correct,"" Kai said.""This second protocol layer is where the 'minter smart contract' operates. It's where you could convert your entire asset into fungible tokens. Think of a smart contract like a digital vending machine – when you put in a certain amount of valid input you would get something in return.""So in this case if you put in your certificate – you put your proof of asset certificate into this minter contract – you would get digital gold tokens in return. For instance, if you have 100 gram gold bar certificate and then you put it through this minter smart contract on Ethereum, check that it's valid, and out would come 100 Digix tokens.""That part is completely autonomous and completely decentralised. Once we deploy it onto the Ethereum network, it remains there indefinitely. We are using the public infrastructure to store all the transactional history and data, so there is no chance of a malicious employee breaking in to our system to change any transactions or to steal the coin, so to speak.""Kai said digitised gold assets on the blockchain or gold tokens, can be exchanged either peer-2-peer on EtherEx, or through crypto-exchanges such as Poloniex, Kraken and Cryptsy.";Bitcoin/blockchain;http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/digix-coinify-marry-bitcoin-ethereum-gold-based-digital-assets-1525790

63;With the growing interest in blockchain technology showing no signs of slowing down, much speculation has focused on the potential savings and benefits across alternative industries- but how much could the banks themselves benefit from the innovative technology?Join Our Bloggers CommunityApplyEarlier this year, a report released by Santander indicated that savings to the tune of $20 million a year could be made through the utilization of ‘distributed ledger’ technology. The focus of the banks’ attention appears to lie with blockchain technology, rather than the Bitcoin currency itself.The systems currently used by the banking giants to keep track of vast account balances could be drastically improved by using elements of technology which has been used to create Bitcoin. The real power of blockchains may lie in their speed and the low costs associated with transmitting value using them.Ripple Labs have renamed to Ripple, signaling the ‘launch’ of their products. The well-funded Ripple project has been running since 2012 and has recently introduced the InterLedger Protocol, which seeks to facilitate the integration of different blockchains. ILP functions as a sort of cryptographic escrow system, which will allow the movement of value between ledgers.The ability to securely move value from blockchain to blockchain will be vital for banks should they wish to utilize their own independent blockchain-type ledgers, which can communicate effectively with alternative networks such as VISA and Ripple.Blockstream is approaching a similar issue through the concept of sidechains, which can be pegged to the main Bitcoin blockchain. The Blockstream approach accepts that the Bitcoin network is an incredibly successful peer-to-peer ecosystem which is difficult to replicate. The decentralized nature of Bitcoin is incredibly important, but the banks are very unlikely to place the same value on this vital element of cryptocurrency.Ripple’s markedly different approach has created independent and centralized blockchains, which do not benefit from the same network of voluntary node operators. However, this important technology will inevitably be utilized by the banks in time and it is projects like Ripple that will more than likely appeal to them.Banks Take NoticeBlockchain is undeniably an important technology, which may have significantly wider applications than simply finance. The sidechains envisioned by Blockstream, as well as other similar projects, point towards the development of an ‘Internet of Value’, which may track our transactions in everything from currency to digital and physical property.Distributed systems are, by their very nature, incredibly secure and protected from interference. When keeping track of important possessions and accounts, it would be foolish for the banks to ignore the power of blockchain technology in the future.It appears that the banking giants of the world are beginning to understand the real power of innovative cryptocurrency technologies. Bitcoin news sites regularly report on the latest speculation and declarations of interest from the banks towards blockchain technology. The staggering amounts of VC funding focused towards Bitcoin and blockchain enterprise has not gone unnoticed with banking executives.Job listings have been posted by banks such as Société Générale, which is hunting for IT developers with specialisms in Bitcoin and blockchain. This surely indicates that in time we will see banks embrace blockchain technology to some degree, be it through an intermediary such as Ripple or perhaps even utilizing a Blockstream-style sidechain!;Bitcoin/blockchain;http://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/exchange/should-banks-adopt-blockchain-technology/
64;"The blockchain technology is creating ripples in the global financial sector. Industry leaders are recognising the “potentially disruptive” technology which can completely revolutionise the financial sector. According to recent reports, the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) is considering replacing its existing clearing and settlement system with blockchain technology. The blockchain technology is nothing but a decentralized public ledger that no one person or company owns or controls; users control it directly. The technology is not just limited to bitcoin but has much broader applications. ASX Managing director Elmer Funke Kupper said that the blockchain could help reduce cost, save time and simplify the clearing and settlement of trades, presently being done by a system known as the Clearing House Electronic Subregister System (CHESS), The Sydney Morning Herald reported.""We see CHESS replacement as a one-in-20-year opportunity,"" Mr Funke Kupper said. ""We're thinking about whether there are smarter ways to do things – to remove a lot of administrative costs and reconciliation costs from the back end of investment banking and broking, and this is where blockchain could be potentially quite helpful."" The SMH further said that the upgrade of the ASX clearing and settlement system will begin by the end of 2016.";Bitcoin/blockchain;http://www.econotimes.com/Australian-Securities-Exchange-To-Embrace-Blockchain-Technology-107768
65;NextBank has announced it is going to introduce a new virtual currency banking platform as part of its strategy to serve bitcoin users all around the world, according to the company’s press release.The new services include international debit cards, accounts supporting both fiat and digital currencies, escrow service, SWIFT transfers, currency exchange and many other services. The funding began in October 2015.NextBank is known for being the globe’s first bitcoin-friendly bank, as it believes the cryptocurrency technology has a great potential.Unlike other banks that charge up to 5% for currency conversions, NextBank charges from just 0.2% to 0.4%. The users’ accounts will support precious metals and more than 135 currencies, including bitcoin, gold, platinum, silver, palladium, USD, EUR and GBP. Moreover, the clients will be able to utilize their accounts for free within 60 months.In order to serve its customers from different countries, NextBank made its services available in over 50 languages. The new platform is projected to be launched in the bank’s offices in the UK, China, France, Germany, Malaysia, Russia and Spain.With the new platform, NextBank intends to simplify the use of financial services for bitcoiners. For operations with the use of digital currency, the bank will offer its clients business or private accounts.The registration process will take less than hour and a half. The users will have to complete an application form and provide photocopies of their utility bill and a passport. After uploading their documents, the customers will have to pass through a virtual interview that will take up to 15 minutes.NextBank allows investors to become a bank’s shareholder by offering stock shares at a price of $100. Investors will obtain 1/250000 of the bank’s revenues and will be paid in bitcoin or fiat currencies. Besides, NextBank will offer multiple benefits for shareholders, including priority account opening, priority application processing and 5 years of free banking.The platform will become available in 2016.However, NextBank is not the only financial institution interested in the bitcoin technology. Last month, it was reported that the world’s nine biggest banks, including Barclays, JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs, are considering adoption of the blockchain technology to drive its use in the financial segment.The banks have already commenced testing the technology, which provides a high level of transparency and reduces the risk of fraud. Meantime, some banks, including UBS and Barclays, are working with bitcoin startups to develop their own blockchain systems.;Bitcoin/blockchain;http://www.coinspeaker.com/2015/10/26/nextbank-the-worlds-first-bitcoin-friendly-bank-announces-upcoming-launch/

67;"Virtual currencies such as the Bitcoin are either being used by the foreign fighters of the Islamic State (IS) or are in the process of being used, says a report by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).Founded in the year1989, the Paris-based FATF is an inter-governmental body which works on measures that may help in combating the flow of funds to the terrorists.In its latest report, titled “Emerging Terrorist Financing Risks,” it has pointed out that the Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies pose a serious threat.Further, the report gave an example of a US national, who was sentenced to 11 years in prison on charges of terrorism, and for also providing the terrorist group with the instructions on how to use Bitcoin.The report added later that the law enforcement agencies are equally worried over the usage of Bitcoin for funding such terrorist organizations, and that they too have noticed that some websites affiliated with these organizations are trying hard to get Bitcoin in donations.Most notably, the report highlighted, what drew the attention of the law enforcement agencies were the internet discussions with regards to the usage of virtual currencies such as Bitcoin in procuring arms.These doubts over the cryptocurrencies, particularly the Bitcoin, are not new; such doubts have been raised in the past as well.Earlier, Director in charge of the Financial Policy and Regulation Department of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) had cited another of FATF report when he said that virtual currency market needs regulations.To allay such concerns, some companies are willingly coming forward to embrace the existing regulations however, it still remains largely an unregulated market.The rising concerns over this aspect of the virtual currency have prompted authorities from different countries voicing their opinion on it, and also in seeking out ways to ensure that they do not fall into the wrong hands.Already, Japan is busy tightening the grip over this market and it is certain that the same will be the case in other countries too.";Bitcoin/blockchain;http://www.newsbtc.com/2015/10/26/scary-is-foreign-fighters-using-bitcoin-to-fund-terror/
68;"On October 22, 2015 the United State Patent and Trademark Office published eBay patent applications for 20150302400, “Distributed Crypto Currency Reputation System” and  20150302401, “Distributed Crypto Currency Unauthorized Transfer Monitoring System”.The reputation application will be discussed in detail below and while controversial, we will offer just an extract of the blacklist application as it does not appear to be a particularly interesting except for who submitted the application.ContextThe applications were filed by eBay, which (at the time) owned PayPal prior to its split.  Both applications list Max Metral as the inventor. Metral joined PayPal Mobile when his company Fig Card was acquired by PayPal. Prior to the eBay/PayPal split the vast majority of patent applications were filed under eBay and not PayPal. PayPal patent applications have only recently started to appear at USPTO and the cryptocurrency patent applications have likely been (re)assigned to PayPal.As detailed in Eric M. Jackson's book “The PayPal Wars,” the online payment company originally had grand plans to liberate oppressed people from their native currencies. Bitcoin seems to now have taken on that role.   In December 2013, it was reported that eBay filed a patent application for programmable money (a.k.a “Gift Token”).  It was also in late 2013 that Xapo’s Wences Casares introduced David Marcus, then president of PayPal to the Bitcoin ecosystem as detailed in Nathaniel Popper’s book ""Digital Gold: Bitcoin and the Inside Story of the Misfits and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money.”In March 2014 it was first reported that eBay filed a patent application, which included a “Bitcoin currency exchanger.” Shortly thereafter in April 2014 the subject cryptocurrency patent applications were submitted to USPTO.Building a Reputation“You can't build a reputation on what you are going to do.”– Henry FordReading patent applications can be a difficult endeavor. The devil is in the details. While the application makes numerous references to “reputation markers”:“[…] the reputation markers provided in the distributed crypto currency reputation system discussed herein may operate substantially similarly to distributed crypto currencies […].”There is only a single block reference to a “reputation coin”:“[…] a payer may transfer electronic coins to a payee and receive products or services in response. If the payee is satisfied with the products or services received, the payer may then transfer all the reputation coins allocated based on that transaction to the payee to indicate that satisfaction. Similarly, if the payee is unsatisfied with the products or services received, the payer may then transfer none, or only some, of the reputation coins allocated based on that transaction to the payee to indicate that dissatisfaction […].”The application attempts to illustrate the number (i.e. “plurality”) of ways reputation can manifest itself through an exhaustive number of combinations of different concepts utilizing this technology. Basically it appears as though the application tries to conceive of any and every implementation that reputation might be used in tandem to a cryptocurrency (and perhaps in its stead).In regards to how the “reputation markers” would be created, the application provides a few examples of how they would come into existence (a couple examples below):“[…] the reputation markers may be created and allocated in an amount that is some percentage of the amount of electronic coins involved in the detected crypto currency transaction […].”“[…] reputation markers may be allocated for crypto currency transactions in a single type of crypto currency (e.g., Bitcoin), or may be allocated for crypto currency transactions across multiple types of crypto currency (e.g., Bitcoin, Litecoin, etc.) [...].”However, the application states that if they haven’t detailed a particular iteration of the allocation (issuance?) concept then the idea is quite logically theirs anyway (you can’t make this stuff up):“[…] While a few examples have been provided, any type of allocation factors may be used in allocating reputation markers based on a crypto currency transaction, and may be selected based on the most logical allocations for crypto currency transactions that will further the goal of accurately reflecting a user's reputation using the reputation markers[…].”The application also claims a time warp feature that enables issuing markers retroactively:“[…] because of the nature of crypto currency public ledgers (i.e., that they include every crypto currency transaction conducted in the history of the crypto currency), the distributed crypto currency reputation system may be used to go ‘back in time’ and reward reputation markers to payers and/or payees for previous crypto currency transactions [...].”Here today, gone tomorrowPayPal’s patent application also brought to mind Augur’s Rep or Reputation Token used by reporters of events on the Ethereum based decentralized Augur prediction market. Both PayPal and Augur mention how users of their tokens/coins can have their respective tokens/coins revoked by the network under certain conditions:According to the PayPal application:“[…] reputation markers may be unallocated, transferred away from, or otherwise made unusable by the user to which they were transferred after a predetermined amount of time […].”According to Augur, which specifically states that it is “not a Cryptocurrency”:   “[…] the Augur network automatically redistributes Rep from reporters in the minority of reporters to the reporters whose reported outcome was in the majority [...].”Of note, OpenBazaar a decentralized marketplace, often compared to eBay, posted their plans for decentralized reputation earlier this month.BlacklistThe “Distributed Crypto Currency Unauthorized Transfer Monitoring System” is essentially a blacklist.From the patent application detail:“[…] public keys may then become blacklisted such that when a current transaction between a payer and a payee is performed, the payer public key that is associated with the current transaction ay [sic] be sent to the system provider and if the system provider determines that the payer public key is blacklisted (i.e., explicitly stored in the database or associated with a public key that is stored in the database), the current transaction may be stopped and/or the payee may be informed not to proceed with the current transaction. Thus, payers that attempt to spend crypto currencies that they have obtained through unauthorized transfer from a previous owner will be unable to do so with payees participating in the system, reducing the value of any crypto currency obtained through unauthorized transfer […].”Since it was first reported that “Obama Initiative Spawns Identity Based Bitcoin Greenlist,” there has been much discussion on how blacklist (whitelists, greenlists etc.) would affect the fungibility of bitcoin. CoinValidation was announced immediately after publication of this article and subsequently a front page post on r/Bitcoin “What a landmark legal case from mid-1700s Scotland tells us about the fungibility and the very nature of money-- and why we should care in light of the recent CoinValidation controversy.” Are the applications patently absurd or do they offer some good (and unique) ideas?

70;"World Patent Marketing, a vertically integrated manufacturer and engineer of patented products, announced that they will accept payment in Bitcoin. World Patent Marketing, which is famous for its innovative business model which they describe as idea to retail, is the most recent cutting edge company to cast their lot with Bitcoin and accept the digital currency as payment. Bitcoin is a privately held digital currency that relies upon a digital clearinghouse known as blockchain. This replaces the banks and escrow agents which are the backbone of Wall Street, stock markets and bond markets around the world. The Bitcoin trading platform, known as T0, automatically encrypts and matches the transaction for 100% privacy and security between the parties. Because of the secure encryption, Bitcoin money can be hidden and secure. The matching system, or ledger as it is known, guaranteed compliance (payment and acceptance) on the part of both parties in any transaction. World governments and reserve banks are deeply concerned about the rise of Bitcoin. If transactions can be conducted with zero transparency, it destroys their ability to track and tax funds. Of course, government concerns are hardly going to hold enthusiasts for the private digital currency back. In fact, privacy and security are what Bitcoin fans love. ""The U.S. Government and the Federal Reserve are terrified of Bitcoin,"" said Scott J. Cooper, CEO and Creative Director of World Patent Marketing, ""It's classic disruptive technology, just like our business model. Disruptive business models, new and better ways of doing things, always scare the daylights out of the old guard. Bitcoin, it's new. It is a huge game changer. Ultimately they may not succeed, but each year it seems that Bitcoin grows more accepted and respected. We're are happy to accept Bitcoin, it's convenient and easy for our customers. And, it may well be the currency of the future."" ""Inventors are excited about it,"" said Cattya Bella DuBois, Executive Vice President of World Patent Marketing.

71;There are many factors that determine if a firm will accept Bitcoin. The largest component of the decision is whether or not the firm believes that accepting Bitcoin will increase overall revenue and generate profits that are greater than or equal to the cost of implementing Bitcoin payments into their platform. Many POS systems are capable of integrating Bitcoin with ease and with little to no cost for the business, but what good is that if the company doesn’t expect any sales in Bitcoin? Let’s take into consideration a company that manufactures a product to sell to retail stores. This company, named Company X, would have little interest in accepting Bitcoin payments unless there was interest from one of the retail stores that frequently purchased merchandise from Company X. Company X would also have no incentive to purchase Bitcoin to pay for materials if its material supplier didn’t accept Bitcoin payments. Companies like X which, don’t sell directly to consumers, would never have a reason to use Bitcoin unless one of its major customers or suppliers expressed interest in using it. Lack of interest or understanding can also play a role in this decision.Let’s take another business into account, coffee shop Y. Coffee shop Y is an independently owned coffee shop that sells various drinks and bagged coffee beans and grinds to customers. If Y has a POS system that can integrate Bitcoin with little to no cost, then it is likely that the coffee shop  will accept Bitcoin payments, as it should expect to increase overall revenue. Small brick and mortar stores like Y are more likely to integrate Bitcoin as the cost and risk are virtually zero.Larger firms (especially corporations) are less likely to integrate Bitcoin, as the cost and risk is much greater and stockholders have a say in the matter, something that might hinder the company from choosing to accept Bitcoin. Because large companies almost always have their own proprietary systems, the cost of implementing Bitcoin is much greater. Unless the firm’s market research analysts predict significant increases in revenue over a long period of time, the opportunity cost will exceed the benefits, and the funds needed to integrate Bitcoin payments would be better spent elsewhere or in another investment. This is the reason why larger corporations don’t accept Bitcoin on a whole.Accepting Bitcoin does increase overall revenue and results in less fees for transactions, but many companies do not expect that the profits from accepting Bitcoin will exceed the costs of implementing it in the first place and, therefore, choose to spend the money somewhere else. Until consumer demand shifts significantly, brick and mortar and small online stores will continue to drive Bitcoin acceptance on the whole.;Bitcoin/blockchain;http://insidebitcoins.com/news/bitcoin-in-business-why-dont-most-businesses-accept-digital-currency/35220
72;Everybody’s talking about blockchain, but no one wants to utter the word that’s most commonly associated with it.Bitcoin.It’s like the ugly duckling of the digital currency underworld that just can’t seem to stay afloat in a sea of controversy. So much that the mainstream banks are talking about the concept of how to leverage its technology without actually having to talk or touch the concept of bitcoin.That’s where the blockchain comes back into the mix — aka the swan of the blockchain-bitcoin tale. But sometimes, even if you put lipstick on a pig, it’s still a pig. And even if you have a princess give it a kiss, it’s not going to turn that frog into a prince.That’s the conundrum the blockchain and bitcoin have today. Most who are talking the blockchain admit that they don’t like to associate it with bitcoin, but everyone knows that you can’t talk blockchain without talking bitcoin.But as MPD CEO Karen Webster pointed out in her controversial column this week, it’s imperative to separate the bitcoin from the blockchain — posing the questions: Can we agree to move time, energy and brain cells away from bitcoin as an alternative currency? And to disentangle the technology of the blockchain away from it, too?As she explains in the piece, the blockchain is a technology that is used to continuously record every bitcoin transaction that takes place. It is the distributed database or public ledger that updates itself every 10 minutes and is the technology that underpins bitcoin. And that’s the very reason why the two haven’t been able to untangle themselves from the same conversation.But Wall Street and major banks across the world have started the conversation about the power behind the blockchain — sans bitcoin. While bitcoin cannot be talked about without talking about the blockchain, it appears the blockchain can very much be talked about without talking bitcoin.Still, some are still using them interchangeably. And until that stops, the blockchain won’t be able to reach its full innovative potential among the mainstream financial services.And that’s where the conversation has begun to shift among the financial service players who realize the power of the blockchain when the other B word is left out.Take, for example, what ex-JPMorgan exec Blythe Masters — who just this year traded in her Wall Street getup to join the digital currency world — said about the blockchain and distributed ledgers.“Distributed ledger technology does have the potential to be disruptive of certain business models. But it has at least as much potential to be enormously empowering of existing business models in terms of making them lower cost, more efficient and less risky,” she said at a conference earlier this year.New research from Greenwich Associates seems to confirm the concept that blockchain and bitcoin don’t have to go hand in hand.In fact, nearly three-quarters of financial industry experts agree that blockchain technology can take off and thrive, even if bitcoin doesn’t. According to reports, Greenwich Associates found that 73 percent of FinServ experts agreed that the blockchain is not dependent on bitcoin to impact the market.Additional findings conclude that nearly one-third (32 percent) believe that legal and compliance officials will trust payments made via the blockchain, and an additional 38 percent said that they believe these personnel will “eventually” trust the technology.Thirteen percent of those surveyed said that “more regulation is needed” before regulators and compliance officials can establish trust in payments via blockchain. About one-tenth, however, said that this trust is unlikely to ever take shape in the market.“For the blockchain or another distributed ledger to provide this clarity to the market, market participants and the legal system would all have to recognize the ledger as the golden copy of who owns what,” the report concluded. “This is technically possible but not a reality just yet.”Regardless, the industry seems to think that should the blockchain take off as an accepted technology in payments, bitcoin doesn’t need to be a part of the equation — except for those with a background in bitcoin.“This result doesn’t scream controversial,” the report said. “But while capital markets professionals (who make up most of our sample) are convinced, those with backgrounds in bitcoin and the blockchain are not.”Still, for now, bitcoin continues to drag down blockchain conversations. And that’s as more financial leaders have stepped up to defend the concept of distributed ledgers and digital currency without naming bitcoin by name.“We shouldn’t be focused on the adoption of a digital currency. The underlying technology is a powerful one, and I think that we will see adoption of that technology much sooner,” said Mariano Belinky, the managing director at Santander InnoVentures.Alex Batlin, the former engineer heading up UBS’ London-based blockchain innovation lab, said in an interview with CoinDesk: “In principle, it’s [blockchain technology] probably one of the biggest confluences of technology and business right now.”For now, most of the discussion seems to be on explaining the technology of blockchain. Since the easiest comparison to make people understand how it works is to throw bitcoin into the mix, it makes sense that the bitcoin name hasn’t faded away.Luckily, there’s more and more pieces floating around about how the blockchain works, why it underpins things like bitcoin, but means so much more than what most think about the digital currency world.In a contributed piece featured on Forbes this week, Arvind Krishna, senior vice president and director of IBM Research, shares how the blockchain — which he noted is “little understood outside a small fraternity of computer scientists” — has the potential to overhaul our financial and business ecosystems.“To me, blockchain is the more interesting phenomenon. It’s a completely novel architecture for business — a foundation for building a new generation of transactional applications that establish trust and transparency while streamlining business processes. It has the potential to vastly reduce the cost and complexity of getting things done. Essentially, it could help bring to business processes the openness and hyper-efficiency we have come to expect in the Internet Era,” he wrote.Everything from its integration of Internet of Things tech to how data (and money) is transferred and shared makes a good case for blockchain’s tech. But for now, Krishna wrote, we’re still “pushing old procedures through new pipes.”And that’s where the change may be needed.“Blockchain-based systems could help radically improve whole industries, beginning with banking and insurance. But its impact could be much broader. It could make a difference whenever valuable assets are transferred from one party to another and whenever you need to know for certain that a piece of digital information — anything from electronic artwork to the terms of a business agreement — is unique and unchangeable by any party without the agreement of all parties,” he continued.And that’s the real value that isn’t being discussed as much — because the conversation still has bitcoin trailing behind. So perhaps for now, it’s best to take the lipstick off that pig and call things what they are: Call bitcoin, bitcoin and blockchain, blockchain.;Bitcoin/blockchain;http://www.pymnts.com/news/2015/whats-in-a-name-the-blockchain-bitcoin-conundrum/
73;"Bitcoin might seem like an odd retirement asset: Most investors lack real knowledge of it, and it holds only a minuscule share of the $24 trillion U.S. retirement and pension fund asset market. However, it might soon play a much larger role in your retirement future.The technology behind Bitcoin is expected to transform the global financial markets in the years ahead, making transactions easier and more convenient worldwide, which could ease its adoption as a retirement asset. But the currency has its drawbacks. Retirement advisors consider bitcoin risky, volatile, unregulated and unsuitable for long-term investments. Here’s what you need to know before including bitcoin in your retirement strategy.Bitcoin is considered a transformational invention because it acts both as a digital currency and as an open source software called blockchain technology. As a digital currency, bitcoin can be managed electronically from anywhere in the world. It also is becoming more widely accepted by banks and merchants. In its other form, as an open source software, the bitcoin blockchain platform, which serves as a public ledger of all bitcoin transactions, is being used by institutional traders and software developers to transform the operational and transactional sides of the financial industry. Yet while institutional market users hail bitcoin as a new force that is capable of changing the administrative side of financial markets, average investors are still scratching their heads over its importance.To be sure, some investors were attracted to bitcoin after watching its big swings in value. According to CoinDesk.com, the Bitcoin Price Index was at $13 on January 2, 2013; $1,147 on December 4, 2013; and $534 on February 25, 2014. Of course its value also can plunge dramatically, and it faces many other hurdles as a retirement asset.";Bitcoin/blockchain;http://www.gobankingrates.com/investing/make-bitcoin-part-retirement-plan/
74;Financial regulators and the courts are not clear about how to classify bitcoin. Recent rulings have found it to be a cash equivalent, a security, a commodity and a foreign currency. This confusion explains why regulators are uncertain about its legal and regulatory jurisdiction.  The IRS contends that bitcoin is considered property in the United States. This means an investment structure cannot directly own bitcoin, but it can hold bitcoin as part of shares in an investment trust. It has only been allowed into the retirement accounts of accredited investors and even then, it had to be through the Bitcoin Investment Trust. Then, there are the operational hurdles. “As of right now, major IRA custodians won’t accept bitcoin investments in a tax-advantaged account. So at this point, if you want to invest in bitcoins, the simplest way is to outright buy them,” said Andy Brantner, a certified financial planner and investment blogger at Start Investing Online.Related: Is the U.S. Government Going to Regulate Bitcoin?The Risk of Bitcoin“Bitcoin is an interesting piece of news to follow, but it’s certainly not something I’d recommend including in a long-term investment portfolio, especially with an IRA,” said Elle Kaplan, CEO of LexION Capital Management in New York. “I always stress a long-term investment approach — particularly for your Golden Years and bitcoin definitely does not fit in that picture.“Bitcoin is not a stock, not a bond and not a recognized currency that any government issues or supports,” Kaplan said. “It’s also completely unregulated and completely uninsured. While the stories of bitcoin’s dramatic rise in value, from pennies to hundreds of dollars each may seem appealing in the short-run, the majority of its value could disappear in a split second. Bitcoin is something that could disappear in a year. It is not something to depend on in a decade,” she added.Bitcoin is an electronic currency, so merchants who receive it cash it in at its face value to pay salaries, bills or just take it home as profit. In almost all cases, bitcoin is spent immediately. As a result, it trades at, or often less than, its face value, according to futurist and writer Giulio Prisco.    The Volatility of Bitcoin“Bitcoin is a very risky investment because its valuation is mostly driven by speculation. People who use the bitcoin network for transferring value generally don’t care about the exchange rate because they enter and exit the system fast enough to avoid being exposed to much volatility,” said Jameson Lopp, an engineer at a bitcoin startup in Durham, N.C.This might help explain why the price of bitcoin dropped 60 percent from January 2014 to December 2014, according to the Coindesk Bitcoin Price Index. Similarly, the average daily price change of bitcoin versus the U.S. dollar between July 2010 and August 2013 was 0.7 percent, which “is quite a lot compared to other assets,” according to Bitcoin Magazine.;Bitcoin/blockchain;http://www.gobankingrates.com/investing/make-bitcoin-part-retirement-plan/

The first is the latest generation of custom ASICs for Bitcoin mining released by BitFur. The new 16 nm ASICs are rated at four times the processing power of the previous generation's 28 nm process chips. The second is the result of BitFury's acquisition of liquid cooling technology company Allied Control. Allied's technology is a passive, two-phase immersion cooling process that is claims results in a cooling efficiency increase of as much as 4000 percent.BitFury has been very energy-aware in the placement of its existing data centers, making use of a colocation provider in Iceland and building its own data center in the city of Gori, Georgia, the latter being built with the Georgian Co-investment Fund.

77;Crypto exchange software provider AlphaPoint has announced its launch of a blockchain technology solution, StreamCore, geared toward financial institutions.The solution is designed to be flexible for the exchange of multiple assets, and configurable to various levels of permissioning. Whereas Bitcoin’s blockchain network is open to any participant and is secured via Bitcoin miners, permissioned systems are controlled by their respective institutions. Variants of permissioned systems are being explored by many financial institutions and startups, as it may be more conducive for regulated trading environments.AlphaPoint CEO Joe Ventura explained to Finance Magnates that the solution can be plugged into Bitcoin for those requiring such flexibility. “StreamCore will be able to operate as a standalone platform, however operators can also link it to other blockchains, such as bitcoin, for instance, in order to enhance auditability,” he said.Bitcoin’s blockchain technology, and others inspired by it, are envisioned to potentially revolutionize the way assets are traded and settled. Dozens of banks are now exploring the technology, which can potentially be adapted toward the transfer of stocks, fiat currencies and derivatives. Settlement would occur in real-time, and the record of transaction would be immutable, validated by the network’s distributed participants.Joining the Blockchain RaceThe announcement comes as part of the latest trend of startups traditionally engaged in developing the bitcoin-as-a-currency economy jumping into the blockchain tech space. Among exchanges, itBit, the first bitcoin exchange to be granted a regulatory charter, got into the blockchain game with its ‘BankChain’ solution for Wall Street. It unveiled its vision at a secretive and exclusive event in New York in July.Bitcoin mining giant BitFury is also apparently entering the blockchain race. It too hosted a secret blockchain summit, this one in the United Arab Emirates just over two weeks ago.Asked if, considering the launch, the startup still values bitcoin for its prospective capabilities as a currency, Ventura explained:“We absolutely believe bitcoin will continue to grow as a currency – the first and by far the most active blockchain application at the moment is bitcoin the currency, with some $2.1 billion having moved across the network in the last 30 days.  We also believe that blockchain technologies will transform financial applications beyond currency exchange, and that these will continue to gain traction.”Indeed, Ventura indicated that the solution would integrate with AlphaPoint’s existing infrastructure including asset exchange, payments, real-time accounting, and multi-asset risk management.“In effect, the solution provides exchange operators a built-in, auditable record of exchange actions, which can be permissioned, apportioned, and selectively shared with stakeholders and partners alike as needed (e.g. auditors, clearinghouses, regulators, market makers, banks) – both for auditing purposes, and for strategic partnership integrations,” Ventura said.The trading technology provider, which secured $1.35 million in funding just over one year ago, powers bitcoin exchanges big and small. Around the time of the funding, it partnered with Bitfinex- currently the world’s second largest USD-based trading venue, based on 30-day volume- to revamp its trading engine.With its latest venture, it is joining an increasingly competitive race to grab the attention of financial institutions looking to enhance their offerings with the latest technology. Larger banks have been developing their own in-house blockchains, and a sizeable proportion of them are joining industry-wide consortiums to help standardize it. At the same time, numerous crypto startups have been leveraging their blockchain expertise to develop institutional solutions;Bitcoin/blockchain;http://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/exchange/crypto-exchange-software-provider-alphapoint-enters-blockchain-race/
78;Coinbase has announced that its customers across 26 countries [in Europe] can buy Bitcoin “instantly” starting today, reported CoinDesk.According to a Coinbase blog post, customers in 26 European countries can now buy Bitcoin “instantly” with 3D Secure-enabled credit and debit cards.Previously, the “instant” purchase option was available only to the holders of US-based Visa and Mastercard credit cards, with the European users having the only option of topping up their accounts via bank transfers, which cannot be used for “instant” purchase.Last month, Coinbase launched the “instant” feature for its customers in the UK and Spain.Explaining how one can get started, the blog post says, “New users can sign up for an account and existing users can sign in, visit the payments method page and click “Add Credit / Debit Card.”Once added, the payment method can be selected on the buy page to “instantly” purchase Bitcoin in pound sterling or euro.The blog post adds, “Since credit and debit cards will not require a customer to pre-fund their Coinbase account with a bank transfer, customers can now receive bitcoin much faster.”According to CoinDesk, most banks in Europe support Visa’s 3D Secure protocol, which requires users to prove their identities via password. Although instant, Coinbase will charge 3% convenience fee for the service. At present, only Visa, Mastercard and Maestro cards are accepted, and all purchases must be over 1 pound sterling.Advising on how one can determine if their card supports 3D Secure, Coinbase suggests contacting the bank to inquire about it, or simply trying adding their card to their Coinbase account. “You will get an error message if your card does not support 3D Secure,” says the blog post.Coinbase, which has so far raised $106 million in VC funding, also announced that Bitcoin users in Liechtenstein and Slovenia can now buy and sell on its platform. The users in these two countries, however, will use SEPA transfers and will not be able to use the “instant” purchase feature.In the US, the firm has so far included 36 states, adding South Dakota yesterday.;Bitcoin/blockchain;https://coinreport.net/coinbase-allows-buying-bitcoin-with-3d-secure-debit-credit-cards-in-26-european-countries/
79;While the BitLicense has caused many companies to leave New York, those that intend to stay are progressing though the regulatory process. This week, one of the world’s largest Bitcoin services and wallet providers Coinbase became the 25thcompany to file for a BitLicense, which is expected to cost more than $100,000 in legal and compliance fees, according to Bitstamp Executive Vice President and chief legal officer George Frost.Since February, Coinbase has continued to work with the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) to improve the regulations and restrictions set on digital currencies such as bitcoin. Today, Coinbase is trying to engage with NYDFS in other states to become a fully licensed bitcoin exchange across the United States.“Plenty of attention has been placed on New York, but the BitLicense application process is just one part of a larger multi-state licensing strategy that Coinbase has been executing for nearly two years and at significant expense,” a Coinbase spokesperson told Bitcoin Magazine. “Our plan has always been to work with the [NY]DFS, as we have with other states, to get fully licensed and continue to serve consumers, merchants and developers across the U.S.”Real CostDepending on the size and nature of the business, the total cost required to become licensed in New York and to be fully compliant with BitLicense varies. The total cost for Bitstamp, the third-largest bitcoin exchange by trading volume, was around $100,000 including all fees, legal costs, and labor. This does not include the ongoing costs of compliance or future filings with the NYDFS.In contrast, medium-sized bitcoin exchange Coinsetter has spent around $50,000, according to Jaron Lukasiewicz, Coinsetter CEO and founder. “I think its bigger cost, though, has been in the uncertainty it created for investors looking to invest in our space – hopefully that will begin to reverse itself now,” he said.Although a Coinbase spokesperson declined to disclose the total amount of money the company has spent to comply with the BitLicense, he told Bitcoin Magazine, “The process was a significant undertaking … and we’re fortunate to have the internal resources and competent team to get this done. Our plan has always been to obtain the licensing required to operate in the state of New York, and we applied for the BitLicense as soon as it had been finalized by the [NY]DFS.”Coinbase’s Contribution to BitLicenseCoinbase is one of the companies that submitted comments on initial drafts of the BitLicense to the NYDFS. Feedback from the Bitcoin industry was responsible for many of the changes and improvements made to the initial drafts of the BitLicense.In one of the early versions drafted by the NYDFS, there was significant overlap between existing money transmitter regulations and the provisions of the BitLicense. Coinbase submitted a formal response to the NYDFS, asking for this duplication to be removed.Coinbase said “the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network put a powerful anti-money laundering policy in place,” and that some of the provisions of the BitLicense could compel licensees to manage proprietary payment networks, thus removing the open protocol attribute of bitcoin. Coinbase said the BitLicense should just apply to businesses that hold funds on behalf of their customers.This marks the start of Coinbase’s ambitious mission to become the first fully compliant bitcoin exchange throughout U.S. The firm has secured $75 million USD in its latest funding round in January, and plans to allocate a big part of its fund to become licensed in as many states as possible, to keep the title of the largest bitcoin exchange in the country.;Bitcoin/blockchain;https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/companies-leave-ny-coinbase-submits-bitlicense-application-1440025274
80;On Thursday, the European Court of Justice ruled that Bitcoin must be treated in the same manner as more traditional currencies for the purpose of tax law enforcement. This decision now means digital currency transactions will receive the same exemption from the consumption tax which euros enjoy. In the ruling, the Court declared that it could identify no reason why these currencies should be treated any differently for tax purposes, since Bitcoins “have no purpose other than to be a means of payment.”This decision should help to provide greater clarity for the digital currency industry in Europe, and stands in stark contrast to the somewhat confusing situation that currently exists on the other side of the Atlantic. Government agencies within the United States have taken differing stances on cryptocurrency over the last year, with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission declaring them to be commodities similar to precious metals, even as the Internal Revenue Service argued that they are a form of property.;Bitcoin/blockchain;http://dcebrief.com/digital-currency-weekly-recap-10-25-2015/
81;While the United States and many other countries continue to struggle with issues related to digital currency, other governments are pressing ahead with plans to provide the regulatory clarification many believe necessary for continued innovation and growth. The government of the island of Jersey - a self-governing Crown dependency in the English Channel - has recently announced its intent to work next year to establish a legal framework to better govern digital currency business activity in its territory.In a policy statement released by Senator Philip Ozouf, Jersey’s Assistant Chief Minister, the government stressed the potential economic benefits the island could enjoy due to its continued embrace of FinTech, noting that “Ultimately, the technologies being developed today will revolutionize the way we bank, the way we invest, the way companies raise money. It will lead to new products, new services, new lenders and many new opportunities.” That succinct observation serves as the foundation for the island’s policy regarding digital currency, which will strive to balance the need for a light regulatory touch that “encourages confidence and innovation in the digital sector” - while at the same time providing enough regulation to protect Jersey from the risk that digital currency could be used to finance terror or facilitate money laundering schemes.;Bitcoin/blockchain;http://dcebrief.com/digital-currency-weekly-recap-10-25-2015/
82;A Spanish newspaper is reporting that the city council in Barcelona has announced plans to introduce its own digital currency sometime before the summer of 2016. While the proposal has been met with skepticism by officials in the nation’s central bank, it has sparked interest elsewhere. Few details are known at this point, since the proposal remains in the development phase. However, the details that have been released indicate a level of innovation and experimentation that is far in excess of what citizens typically see from government at any level.As of now, the plan is to provide local residents with their own mobile wallets, and the ability to exchange their digital currency for euros. The city’s mayor, Ada Colau, had promised to introduce some type of local cryptocurrency when she ran for the office, and during the campaign expressed her belief that it could help to spark new commerce within the city. If it succeeds in encouraging more spending within the city by adding additional benefits for its usage, it could help to ensure that more of Barcelona’s wealth remains with its own citizens.All of this is taking place even as Catalonia continues to toy with the idea of separating from Spain within the next year and a half - a move that the Spanish constitution forbids, and which the central government of the nation is sure to strongly resist. Just last November, more than 2 million residents in Catalonia voted in a nonbinding, symbolic referendum for secession. 81 Percent voted in favor of forming their own nation, but less than half of the area’s eligible voters actually showed up to the polls.Still, the desire for independence is strong in the region, and dates back to the middle of the 19th Century, and gained intensity during the Spanish Civil War and the years afterward when the region suffered under the dictatorship of Francisco Franco. Despite the return of autonomy in 1977, there has been a steady increase in support for independence and the region’s parliament now has a 60% majority of representatives in favor of separating from Spain.;Bitcoin/blockchain;http://dcebrief.com/digital-currency-weekly-recap-10-25-2015/

86;"When Goldman Sachs talks, people all over the world listen. Today Goldman is talking about the blockchain. What the heck is the ""blockchain""? Only the next biggest thing since the Internet, according to such tech visionaries such as noted venture capitalist Marc Andreessen. For most of those outside of Silicon Valley and other tech centers, the blockchain is some mysterious computer thing that works with Bitcoin. What they may fail to realize is that the blockchain could completely change the world by allowing us to finally establish true trust and accountability online. We got a glimpse of the blockchain future when nine of the world's largest banks, including Goldman Sachs and Barclays, announced that they would create a Blockchain system to use for establishing trust and managing transactions in global financial markets.A blockchain is public ledger of transactions that is distributed among all participants in a market or system. Each transaction that happens within a market or system must be verified by a strong majority of participants. It's very difficult to falsify transactions in a blockchain because each transaction generates a strong cryptographic signature. Once a transaction is entered in the public ledger, it cannot be erased. Because every transaction is public record and known to everyone in the blockchain, it's nearly impossible to hide untoward activities. What this means is that complete strangers can transact business without ever meeting each other or really trusting each other. The other part of blockchain, which is equally intriguing, is that it allows for very rapid settling of transactions. With stock trades, for example, today it takes nearly a week for most trades to officially ""clear."" With a blockchain infrastructure, a trade could clear as fast as the bits cross the wires.There's more. Financial applications are only one of the possible use cases. Blockchain is much bigger than finance. Medical records and voting records could be secured and verified by blockchain. Small businesses could use blockchain to create trusted trading platforms among themselves. There are a number of high-profile startups, such as Ethereum, trying to make toolkits that would allow anyone to build their own blockchain-based applications and markets without having to build the complicated and technologically taxing guts of the blockchain.According to venture capitalist and blockchain expert William Mougayar who has built a database of blockchain startups, there are nearly 500 blockchain-based startups across more than four dozen sub-categories including media, health, education and, of course, many flavors of finance";Bitcoin/blockchain;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alex-salkever-/9-giant-banks-make-a-deal_b_8143356.html

88;Tether has proven to be a unique payment service that protects its customers against Bitcoin’s price volatility. Despite Bitcoin slowly transitioning from its “infantile” stages into globally renowned payment method, there are still hefty price swings on a regular basis. And this is exactly what is putting off a lot of merchants, as they feel it is too risky to accept Bitcoin payments at this point in time.This is where Tether offers something completely different compared to more “traditional” Bitcoin payment processors. Tether protects against Bitcoin price volatility by backing payments with fiat currency on a 1:1 ratio. Or to be more precise, the company “tethers” a payment reserve to each Bitcoin payment.But that is not all, as Tether supports three major fiat currencies in the form of USD, JPY and EUR. Because of this fact — combined with the ideology of using Bitcoin as a backend — any deposit made as a “Tether” can be withdrawn in the same amount, regardless of whether it’s in Bitcoin, yen, dollars, or euros.GoCoin’s CEO Steve Beauregard explains why his company decided to partner with Tether:“By utilizing Tether’s unique business model of linking digital currency to in-hand reserves, we’re able to stabilize value fluctuations for our merchants, making digital currency even more appealing to them.”GoCoin: Providing Merchant Services for Multiple Digital CurrenciesBitcoinist_GocoinOne of the aspects that make GoCoin stand out from its competitors is the fact it supports other currencies than just Bitcoin. Both Litecoin and Dogecoin payments can be processed by the GoCoin platform, giving you additional ways to generate revenue and attract more customers to your website.Ever since Gocoin was founded in 2013, the company has secured over $2 million USD in funding in order to expand and streamline its service. This most recent partnership with Tether is just one of fruits of that labour, and a great reward for all the hard work that is being done behind the scenes over at GoCoin.The Partnership DetailsThe main idea behind the partnership between GoCoin and Tether is split into multiple parts. First of all, current GoCoin merchants can transact with Tether in the USD fiat currency right away, with support for both JPY and EUR coming at a later stage. No official date was announced as to when this integration would be completed, however.Secondly, and this is the most important part for any merchant, all fees associated with dealing in fiat currency — through traditional payment methods such as credit cards and banks — will be nullified. Tether uses the Bitcoin blockchain to transfer volume, and does not rely on any aspect of the current financial infrastructure to do so.Bitcoinist_shutterstock_72767158“Merchants get to deal with Tether’s versions of USD, JPY and EURO, which can then be withdrawn (or transferred) to other local currencies. In doing so, Tether gives Bitcoin an agnostic store of value and the process removes much of the complexity surrounding transacting in Bitcoin.” – TetherLast but not least, the value of a “Tether” will always remain the same, regardless of what the Bitcoin price does. This is a double-edged blade, however, as you will not benefit from a sudden Bitcoin price increase after receiving a payment, yet you will not be affected by a Bitcoin price drop after a transaction either.A Win For All Parties InvolvedThere is an advantage for GoCoin to be found in this partnership as well. Digital currency payment processing services rely on buying extra bitcoins when the market value falls in order to maintain reserves in compliance with the transparency promised to its customers. In this case, that burden will fall completely on Tether’s shoulders.Such a partnership would not be viable if there weren’t something in it for Tether either. By taking the full brunt of the burden of maintaining Bitcoin liquidity for GoCoin, the company will create its “reserves buffer” as soon as the Bitcoin price rises again. And with Bitcoin prices still suffering from the occasional fluctuation, this could happen rather sooner than later.Reeve Collins, co-founder and CEO of Tether, told Bitcoinist,“We’re proud to add such a respected name as GoCoin to our list of partners. We know both GoCoin and its customers will find peace of mind now that they can achieve the low transaction costs of digital currency with the stability of dollars.”;Bitcoin/blockchain;http://insidebitcoins.com/news/accepting-bitcoin-made-easier-by-tether-and-gocoin/31756

93;BitPay wants ChainDB to secure data using the block chain, and the payments processor needs the Bitcoin community’s help with the project.In an effort that is more like Factom than storj, BitPay outlines in a recent paper a mechanism for creating counterfeit resistant databases using the Bitcoin mining network. A so-dubbed ChainDB (chain database) would benefit from the full power of the Bitcoin mining network “to create an unforgeable history of database mutations.”According to BitPay, “the existing Bitcoin network can be leveraged for new applications with little or no change to the core Bitcoin protocol.”The firm says it would try to avoid the risk involved with “any material change to the core Bitcoin protocol.”As the company writes in its paper:Bitcoin [1] has demonstrated a new approach to securely storing data in the cloud. The Bitcoin database services millions of users around the planet and has thus far shown itself to be essentially invulnerable to attack. Bitcoin does not require boundary defenses to protect the integrity of the database, instead it relies on a consensus of peers to build an independently verifiable historical record.In order to undermine the Bitcoin network, and revise the history of the database, a nefarious agent would need computing power in excess of the combined power of the honest participants in the Bitcoin network.This is what BitPay wants to do, but for database storage.ChainDB seeks to apply that same approach to securing arbitrary sets of data in the cloud. However, rather than create yet another Bitcoin clone that requires its own mining network, ChainDB uses the existing Bitcoin mining network.A ChainDB organizes transactions (in the database sense) into blocks that are then referenced by transactions in the Bitcoin block chain. Validation rules specific to a ChainDB govern whether a given chain of blocks and transactions is valid. Participants in a chain create blocks and append them to the chain by competing to get their block defining transaction into the Bitcoin block chain. Block selection rules govern which participant successfully defines the next block. As with Bitcoin, the winner of a block receives rewards in the form of newly created assets or transaction fees. The exact nature and composition of the reward is specific to a chain.BitPay looks to develop the technology due to the daily needs of running the world’s largest Bitcoin payment processor. As the team writes:“Much of this work has evolved from the need to secure BitPay’s payment system and many hours spent brainstorming how to accomplish that task. Many brilliant developers (and non-- developers) have contributed various ideas reflected in this paper (and many ideas that will be covered in future papers on ChainDB). ”BitPay recognizes various projects that informed their development of ChainDB, including Namecoin, the BitShares project, Ethereum and Truthcoin.BitPay also mentions Factom, which “has advanced the concept of using the Bitcoin block chain directly for timestamping data. These are just a few of the many projects that are advancing the state of the art in Bitcoin.If you would like to comment on the project to BitPay directly, they've set up a lab to do so on their forums.

95;One of the most prominent features of the BitX Smart Wallet is the option for users to buy and sell Bitcoin from within the application itself. However, as you would come to expect from a Bitcoin exchange, this functionality only seems to be available to users on their own problem. Furthermore, this feature is limited to supported regions only, making it unavailable for specific countries. Regardless of its limited availability, it is a positive trend to see wallet developers enable in-app trades of Bitcoin against fiat currency. For novice users, these types of mobile Bitcoin wallets will be very useful, as they can do everything they need and want within one application, rather than opening a browser window to trade Bitcoin. Navigation is a key element of mobile Bitcoin wallets, and BitX has taken a slightly different direction compared to the competition. By using a card-based navigation system, users can customize their financial experience within the mobile Bitcoin wallet. Less-used or irrelevant cards can be swiped away by the user, to keep the application clutter-free. The reason why this is called a “Smart Wallet” is because this app has been designed to learn more about user behavior. As a direct result, users will receive customized cards to enrich their experience while using the BitX Smart Wallet. Further improvements to this card systems will be made over the coming months, and users can submit their feedback here.Even mobile Bitcoin wallets have to evolve over time and branch out to support other digital currencies as well. BitX Smart Wallet has not done that just yet, but the application supported balances in both Bitcoin and fiat currency. Once again, a possibly beneficial tool for novice Bitcoin users, albeit experienced users may not be blown away by this option. One major feature is not available yet, but BitX has announced it on their blog. The plan is to allow for the generation of virtual credit card numbers within the BitX Smart Wallet, giving users the option to spend Bitcoin anywhere in the world.  The BitX Smart Wallet is available for both Android and iOS users.;Bitcoin/blockchain;http://insidebitcoins.com/news/bitx-smart-wallet-launched-for-mobile-bitcoin-users/35218

With a few taps and swipes, a customer can walk into a dealership and lease a car, after selecting the annual mileage, in less than five minutes. And that is only the beginning.Visa and DocuSign engineers have created an app that will let you buy the car’s insurance just as quickly and easily. No more faxing documents and waiting for insurance waivers to be processed, which can take hours.

100;"Cash is becoming increasingly obsolete as card payments boom across the world. Payments made with debit and credit cards and other non-cash methods jumped 9 percent last year to 390 billion transactions, according to a study published on Tuesday.The 2015 World Payments Report gave an estimate for transactions last year and detailed numbers for the year before.It showed people in Finland made an average of 450 non-cash payments in 2013, more than any other nationality, thanks to innovations in payments system, and a strong economy and private spending. Its cold winters also encourage the use of e-commerce.The report said people in the United States were next most active, making 390 non-cash transactions on average in 2013, followed by the inhabitants of the Netherlands, Australia, Denmark, South Korea and Sweden.Payments by cards, direct debits and credit transfers are booming as people turn to mobile banking, contactless cards and other innovations rather than cash.The report, a joint venture between Capgemini and Royal Bank of Scotland, said further advances could come from blockchain technology -- a growing, decentralized database that allows secure digital transfers.""Blockchain has the potential, in a simple way, to disrupt a lot of the payment infrastructure and the way we conduct business,"" said Teresa Connors, head of client engagement of payment services at RBS, saying the architecture could offer security, an audit trail, transparency and speed.The World Payments Report estimated 390 billion non-cash payment transactions were made last year, up 9 percent from 2013 and up 45 percent from 2009.China's population made fewer than 50 non-cash transactions per person on average in 2013, but that was up 37 percent from the year before. China's growth is being driven by a rising penetration of mobile phones in smaller towns and steps by authorities to accelerate the roll-out of point-of-sale equipment to merchants as well as opening the domestic card payments market to competition.While card payments rise, the decline of cheques looks set to continue.Cheque transactions fell 11 percent in 2013 from the year before and accounted for 4 percent of non-cash payments in Europe and 13 percent in North America, down from 7 percent and 22 percent, respectively, in 2009.The report forecast fewer than 5 billion cheques would be written in 2025, compared with about 25 billion in 2013.";otherFinance;Business insider UK
101;The end of cash? It might not come as fast as you think. The end of cash? It might not come as fast as you think. While cash’s use is in continual decline, claims that it is set to disappear entirely may be premature, according to the Bank of England. Demand for cash is likely to remain “substantial” for a number of years, said Bank staff Tom Fish and Roy Whymark, despite the proliferation of alternative ways to pay in recent years. Cash’s unique qualities - it cannot be traced and does not rely on other technology to work - means that its use “is likely to remain resilient”, the authors claimed. “Cash is not likely to die out any time soon”, they added.The Bank of England predicts that demand for cash will remain 'substantial', in part because hoarding remains so popular. The emergence of alternative payment technologies - including credit and debit cards, as well as a myriad of new electronic systems - have eaten into cash’s once dominant share of the payments space. Last year debit cards were used for £362bn of transactions, compared to £166bn for cash. And the Bank expects cash’s share to continue to ebb. • Apple wants the money in your pocket• How to end boom and bust: make cash illegal The Bank estimates that 21pc to 27pc of everyday transactions last year were in cash, down from between 34pc and 45pc at the turn of the millennium.

102;"Call Cease-Fire in the War on Cash. Last summer, London buses stopped accepting money. To pay your fare, you now have to wave either a prepaid Transport for London Oyster card or a contactless payment bank card at a receiver. For some, not having to dig out a handful of coins is a welcome relief.For others, though, the disappearance of cash represents a dangerous threat to our liberty. A Google search for ""war on cash"" produces 109 million results ranging in negativity from skeptical to outraged. But in Britain, at least, physical currency is losing the so-called war.Last year, non-cash payments in the U.K. economy overtook cash for the first time. And the trend shows little sign of slowing. Figures this week from credit-card company Mastercard show spending by contactless payments in the U.K. soared more than fivefold in the past 12 months, while the number of transactions quadrupled, albeit from a low initial base. Britons have been swift to adopt cards that contain transmitters, and retailers from Tesco to Starbucks to pubs have installed equipment that lets you flash your plastic to pay a bill instantly.Earlier this year, Citigroup Chief Economist and former Bank of England policy maker Willem Buiter published a paper in which he advocated abolishing physical currency altogether. His concern was a technical argument about giving central banks more freedom to drive borrowing costs below zero. The existence of cash sets a lower boundary to central bank policy, because you can avoid the penalty of negative interest rates by holding physical currency rather than having money in a bank account. Buiter argued that the benefits of a cashless society outweigh privacy concerns:Abolishing currency would inevitably be associated with a loss of privacy and create risks of excessive intrusion by the government (and other would-be inspectors). The well-known monetary economist Charles Goodhart indeed refers to the proposal to abolish currency as “shockingly illiberal”. In our view, the net benefit to society from giving up the anonymity of currency holdings is likely to be positive (including for tax compliance).The opponents of the move to digital money see things differently. Here, for example, is a post on the Mises Institute website:The ostensible reason given by our rulers for suppressing cash is to keep society safe from terrorists, tax evaders, money launderers, drug cartels and sundry other villains, real or imagined. But the actual aim of the recent flood of laws rendering cash transactions less convenient or limiting or even prohibiting them is to force the public at large to make payments through the financial system in order to prop up the unstable fractional-reserve banks and, more importantly, to expand the ability of governments to spy on and keep track of their citizens’ most private financial dealings.I've just finished watching a BBC drama called The Last Enemy which paints a dystopian picture of Britain as a police state. As well as tracking people's movements by knowing when they tap a card to use the transport system, one of the key tools used to keep citizens in line is the government's ability to close the bank accounts of alleged undesirables.You don't have to be a conspiracy theorist, though, to appreciate the benefits of having a stash of cash. Greece's temporary introduction of capital controls earlier this year, for example, restricted ATM withdrawals to 60 euros ($68) per day. And on Friday, a glitch in HSBC's U.K. banking computers meant 275,000 payments didn't happen, including end-of-month salary payments worth millions of pounds.It's good that we're embracing new technology that lets us pay a bar bill or buy a bag of groceries with a wave of a card. But it's time to call a cease-fire in the cash war. Buiter's fantasy to the contrary, there's no good reason physical currency shouldn't continue alongside the digital variety. Even if it's never needed in our more efficient economic future, it can serve as a reminder of a more quaint economic past.";otherFinance;bloombergview.com
103;The war on cash continue. Ever heard of Andrew Haldane?He’s the Bank of England’s chief economist. His word carries a lot of weight with the authorities. And last week he let the cat out of the bag: he’s coming for your cash!Haldane gave a speech last week where he explained that central banks have a problem. He calls it the ‘zero lower bound’, or ZLB. In simple terms, the ZLB is the lowest point central banks can push interest rates to without people pulling their money out of the bank and stuffing it in their mattress.Think of it as the point where people say: “enough”.This is a problem for people like Haldane. He sees the ZLB as a constraint on policy – it stops the Bank of England pushing interest rates into strongly negative territory.   Presumably he thinks that would be a good idea. I mean it sounds like a great plan, doesn’t it? The bank can then incentivise (read: force) people to go out and spend their money instead of saving it for the future. All that spending helps the economy grow. The bank’s genius economists save the day!Everyone’s a winner.Well, if believe that, you probably hate Capital and Conflict. Anyway, back to Haldane. As I said, he sees the ZLB as an obstacle to his grand plans.So what’s his solution?Abolish cash, of course!From Haldane’s speech (emphasis mine):“A more radical proposal still would be to remove the ZLB constraint entirely by abolishing paper currency. “This, too, has recently had its supporters (for example, Rogoff (2014)). As well as solving the ZLB problem, it has the added advantage of taxing illicit activities undertaken using paper currency, such as drug-dealing, at source.“A third option is to set an explicit exchange rate between paper currency and electronic (or bank) money. Having paper currency steadily depreciate relative to digital money effectively generates a negative interest rate on currency, provided electronic money is accepted by the public as the unit of account rather than currency. “All of these options could, in principle, solve the ZLB problem. In practice, each of them faces a significant behavioural constraint. Government-backed currency is a social convention, certainly as the unit of account and to lesser extent as a medium of exchange. These social conventions are not easily shifted, whether by taxing, switching or abolishing them.“One interesting solution, then, would be to maintain the principle of a government-backed currency, but have it issued in an electronic rather than paper form. This would preserve the social convention of a state-issued unit of account and medium of exchange, albeit with currency now held in digital rather than physical wallets.“But it would allow negative interest rates to be levied on currency easily and speedily, so relaxing the ZLB constraint.”Note that he never uses the word cash. Instead it’s just ‘paper currency’.It might surprise you but this kind of idea does have its cheerleaders. And not just in central banking circles. Some people with real jobs think it’d be a good idea.Take, for instance, the FT’s Martin Sandbu. In his ‘Free Lunch’ newsletter last week he had this to say (again emphasis mine):“Top economists have called for restrictions on cash because it hampers monetary policy when interest rates are low: the unlimited ability to convert deposit money into cash is thought to mean that central banks cannot bring interest rates in the economy very far below zero. If they do, depositors will simply take cash out, and cash as currently constituted bears a zero interest rate. So what to do if the economy needs strongly negative rates?    “The obvious answer is to constrain the conversion between bank deposits and physical cash.”What all this comes down to is the fact that the great and good of the financial world believe they know how to control and perfect the economy. Like doctors treating a sick patient, they know what the economy ‘needs’ to get better. And what the economy needs is negative interest rates.We’ll leave the elitist undertones of all this to one side for now (“we’re economists and you’re not, so just listen to what we say and don’t question it”).The broader point is that people taking their money out of the bank to avoid negative interest rates is a natural decision. It’s an entirely logical response to the situation.It’s also the natural consequence of central banks’ actions.But people like Haldane don’t want their actions to have consequences. They want to be free to do what they “know” is right.Abolishing cash (or ‘paper currency’) is one way of doing exactly that.We’ve been talking about this threat for a good couple of months here at Capital and Conflict. Tim, Dan, Bill and I have all written about it on numerous occasions.I know some of you see us as paranoid conspiracy theorists as a result of that. At least, I’ve received plenty of emails more or less saying that.If you’re one of those people – or you’re on the fence about Tim Price’s ideas about Financial Martial Law – I hope this is a wakeup call. If the BoE’s chief economist coming out and stating he’d like to abolish cash doesn’t help you see what’s happening, I don’t know what will;otherFinance;moneyweek.com
104;The covert war on cash. Obscured by the giant smoke clouds of the Greek Euro Crisis are other serious events that almost totally evade the view of the press and, thus, many people in Europe. Only sometimes for a short amount of time do they come into light, only to disappear again when the next fatal news from Greece step make the headlines.Almost unbeknownst to a large portion of Europeans is the fact that politicians and economists try to wage a campaign that reminds one of a covert war. This time it is not about drugs, but about another commodity many Europeans have long been used to: cash.Cash in the Crosshairs money-29047_640As a consequence of Greek savers withdrawing money en masse from ATM machines the Greek government took a very offensive step and marched openly forward in the war on cash. The flow of money was severly reduced: At first banks were told to stay closed on work days. Then people were not allowed to transfer money abroad. Next, people were not allowed to withdraw more than € 60 per day. Banks, with the help of the government basically robbed their costumers, forcing them to wait in long queues to beg to receive small morsels of what is actually their private property.Crisis-ridden Greece appears to be an exception, where harsh times seemingly justify harsh meassures. Yet other Europeans countries are long engaged in similiar activities, slowly pushing back the use of cash payments.There is a number of countries where the use of cash is already strictly limited. France, for example has put a ban on cash payments of more than € 1.000. Furthermore banks now have to notify the authorities if someone withdraws more than € 10.000. Italy has restrictions on cash payments, too, outlawing payments of more than € 1.000. But it is not just France and struggling Italy. There are similiar notions in seemingly succesful countries, such as Denmark and Germany. The government of Denmark has put up a notion that would remove businesses obligations to accept cash, transforming the country into a cash-less society. And even German economists, such as Peter Bofinger, call for a ban on cash payments.Many reasons seem to exist for the growing antipathy against cash in these countries. The French government declared that limiting the use of cash will combat crime. After all, cash can not be traced, so it is a useful tool for people who are doing shady deals: tax evasion, fraud, bribery or the sale of stolen goods are easy to commit when untraceable cash is involved. Not just is the government losing money but, cash acts as a resource that enables criminal activities. Take this resource away and crime will disappear.Another argument against the use of cash is that it is an outdated technology that is complicated and cumbersome to use. Digital transactions are less complicated for business operators and takes up less space in costumers purses than coins and notes.Who makes the decisions?The argument about cash being used by criminals appears to be a rather weak excuse after closer inspection. It implies that the use of cash is somehow immoral. Are little kids saving small amounts of coins criminals? Or is grandma storing her pension in her flat a criminal? Or the young man using cash to secretely buy a lewd magazine?The second argument is just as flawed. There are numerous examples where new technologies do not work as intended. Just think of online-banking fraud, technical problems with debit cards or online transactions and other mishaps that happen to people.In the end, both examples are about individual choices. Most people carry both cash and credit cards, since it offers more flexibility. Why does some bureaucrat think he has to crop this flexibility by declaring a certain behaviour as either suspicious or outdated? Can not individual people themselves decide which behaviour suits them best?The arguments quoted above sound very unconvincing and it is hard to believe that these are the actual reasons for the campaigns against cash. A look at the situation in Greece shows us that these superficial explanations are nothing but smoke and mirrors. The true motives must be of economical nature. In order to reach certain economic goals politicians and bankers seem to be eager to sacrifice individual property rights by slowly discouraging the use of cash.;otherFinance;studentsforliberty.org
105;"Banknote recirculation by credit institutions and other cash handlersThe ECB and the national central banks (NCBs) of the Eurosystem are the issuing authorities for the euro banknotes and are tasked with maintaining public trust in the single currency. This is done by, among other things, ensuring the integrity of the euro banknotes in circulation. The possibility of recirculating euro banknotes enables credit institutions and other cash handlers to perform their role in the currency supply chain in a more effective and cost-efficient manner. To ensure the integrity of the euro banknotes, on 16 September 2010 the Governing Council of the ECB adopted Decision ECB/2010/14 on the authenticity and fitness checking and recirculation of euro banknotes, which became applicable on 1 January 2011. The adoption of a legal act came about because of the amendment in 20081 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1338/20012, including: _a direct reference in Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 1338/2001 to “procedures defined by the ECB” in respect of the obligation for the addressees of Article 6(1), referred to as “cash handlers” in Decision ECB/2010/14, to ensure that euro banknotes “which they have received and which they intend to put back into circulation are checked for authenticity and that counterfeits are detected”; _the broadening of the addressees of Article 6 to cover other economic agents (e.g. traders and casinos engaged in the processing and distribution to the public of banknotes via cash dispensers) and transporters of funds. Decision ECB/2010/14 lays down the procedures referred to in Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1338/2001, with which cash handlers have to comply when checking euro banknotes for authenticity and fitness. It has been amended by Decision ECB/2012/19 of 7 September 2012 to extend its scope to the authenticity and fitness checking and recirculation of new series of euro banknotes and to clarify a few requirements. Decision ECB/2010/14 ensures that credit institutions and cash handlers only recirculate euro banknotes if they have been checked for both fitness and authenticity. These checks can be carried out either: (i) by a type of banknote handling machine which has been tested by a Eurosystem NCB; or (ii) by trained staff. Banknotes that have successfully passed machine checks can be reissued via automated teller machines or other customer-operated machines. Banknotes which have been tested by trained staff can only be disbursed over the counter. It is important to note that euro coins are not affected by Decision ECB/2010/14, as they do not fall within the ECB’s competence ";otherFinance;www.ecb.europa.eu
106;Issuance and circulation Legally, both the ECB and the central banks of the euro area countries have the right to issue euro banknotes. In practice, only the national central banks physically issue and withdraw euro banknotes (as well as coins). The ECB does not have a cash office and is not involved in any cash operations. As for euro coins, the legal issuers are the euro area countries. The European Commission coordinates all coin matters at euro area level. For further information, see the European Commission’s website. Responsibilities of ECB and national central banksThe ECB is responsible for overseeing the activities of the national central banks (NCBs) and for initiating further harmonisation of cash services within the euro area, while the NCBs are responsible for the functioning of their national cash-distribution systems. The NCBs put banknotes and coins into circulation via the banking system and, to a lesser extent, via the retail trade. The ECB cannot perform these operations as it does not have its own technical departments (distribution units, banknote processing units, vaults, etc.). ;otherFinance;www.ecb.europa.eu
107;6 Reasons Why Cash is Still The King of Payments. Despite all of the talk about credit cards, debit cards and mobile payments, cash still dominates many forms of payments. In fact, any talk about a cashless society seems tremendously premature.“Debit card use is up” … “The check is an antiquated form of payment” … “Mobile wallet usage is about to take off.”You can’t open a bank or credit union publication today without hearing about the transformation (and disruption) of the payments industry. New players are emerging, with established financial institutions trying to keep up with digital payment innovations.Despite all of this chatter, however, a Federal Reserve report from the Diary of Consumer Payment Choice (DCPC), suggests that cash is still king. The study found that consumers choose to use cash more frequently than any other payment instrument, including debit or credit cards for the following reasons:1.Cash plays a dominant role for small-value transactions2.Cash is the leading payment instrument for specific types of purchases3.Cash is the key alternative when other options are not available4.Cash is the leading payment alternative for Gen Y5.Cash is a primary payment option for lower income segments6.Cash can’t be hackedThe Paradox of CashThere are two main reasons that the much-hyped ‘cashless society’ has not arrived. First, cash continues to remain popular for use in small-dollar transactions by all segments of the population because of its convenience. Second, a rather significant segment of the population remains unbanked or underbanked, thus without access to the primary alternatives to cash. This creates an interesting paradox between the popularity of cash and the value of cash transactions.“Despite the hype around mobile payments, checks are used 14 times more than mobile devices for payments.”In the Fed study, the average American consumer had 59 transactions, including purchases and bill payments, with 23 of these 59 payments involving cash. The graph below shows that, at 40 percent, cash makes up the single largest share of consumer transaction activity, followed by debit cards at 25 percent, and credit cards at 17 percent.Electronic payments account for 7 percent, while checks make up 7 percent. All other payments represent less than 5 percent of monthly transaction activity. Interestingly, despite all of the hype around new forms of digital P2P transactions, text and mobile payments barely register at less than one half of one percent.While the number of cash transactions is high, cash accounts for a relatively small share of total consumer transaction value at 14 percent, with electronic payments making up 27 percent and checks 19 percent. In fact, the average value of a cash transaction is only $21, compared with $168 for checks and $44 for debit cards. 1. Cash for Low-Value PaymentsAs shown below, consumers typically use cash for the large number of small value payments that occur each month. According to the study, about one-third of the average consumer’s monthly payments involve transactions with a “ticket size” less than $10 and two-thirds of these transactions are done with cash. Similarly, consumers use cash for half of all of their transactions valued at less than $50.As can be seen, both the number of cash transactions and cash’s share of transactions fall as the payment value rises. Alternatively, the number of card payments remains roughly the same regardless of transaction amount. Once the size of payment rises above $100, the number and share of electronic payments and checks become significantly more prominent, in part due to the influence of bill payments.2. Cash for Specific UsesThe research on the use of cash found that cash is the number one payment choice for several expenditure categories, including:_Gifts and other person-to-person (P2P) transactions_Food and personal care supplies_Entertainment_Transportation_Medical, educational, and personal services_Government and nonprofit expenditures.It is the second most frequently used payment option for all other categories except housingFor the most part, the average ticket size for many of these expenditure categories is relatively low, in alignment with the first reason that cash remains a prominent transaction choice. Debit cards also tend to be used frequently for these expenditures, indicating that using cash for these transactions was not driven by a lack of other payment options.The research also found that consumers use cash similar to how they use debit and credit cards. The use of credit and debit cards by expenditure category is correlated to that of cash, with food and personal care items making up the largest share of consumers’ use of these instruments. In contrast, consumers seldom use checks for these sorts of day-to-day expenditures.P2P transactions is one area where cash aligns more with check usage than cards, mostly because convenient usage of cards for P2P is not readily available (Square Cash, Google Wallet and PayPal for P2P are still not gaining significant traction). However, while cash is used for more the majority of P2P transactions, these transactions make up a relatively small share (6 percent) of all cash transactions.3. Cash as a Back-Up OptionCash is not the #1 payment choice by the majority of consumers, but it plays a significant role as the fallback payment instrument for most consumers. According to the research, 43 percent of consumers say that the debit card is their payment instrument of choice, while 30 percent of consumers say they prefer cash and 22 percent say credit cards. In all of these cases, the consumer actually uses their preferred choice more than half of the time.“For consumers who prefer a non-cash payment option, cash is their secondary choice”When asked about their backup payment option, however, most consumers who preferred a non-cash payment instrument declared cash as their second choice. Sixty percent of consumers who prefer the debit card, for example, picked cash as their second choice. A similar observation holds true for other payment instruments.Interestingly, debit and credit card customers do not prefer the alternative plastic option as their secondary choice. Possibly reflecting attitudes toward credit use after the financial crisis, consumers who prefer debit cards use the cash alternative 36 percent of the time, while only using credit cards for 7 percent of their transactions.4. Cash Preferred by Gen YConsumers of all age groups list cash as their preferred payment instrument, yet 18 – 24 year olds actually prefer cash at a higher percentage (40 percent) than any age group. At the same time, this age group also has the highest preference for debit cards, potentially because they have limited incomes and therefore limited access to banking services.Alternatively, older consumers are more likely to prefer credit cards and checks than younger adults – and are less likely to prefer cash. This affinity to credit cards by seniors, relative to other age groups, is most likely attributable to income, wealth and the tenure of financial relationships. As shown below, virtually no consumers younger than 35 prefer checks, which the study attributes more to engrained habits than a true preference of checks as a convenience payment option.As with the trends found throughout the study, young adults use cash far more than any other option (based on number of transactions), while all age groups tend to use cash more than their stated preferences would indicate.5. Cash Preferred by Unbanked and UnderbankedThe study found that 55 percent of consumers with household incomes less than $25,000 per year prefer cash over non-cash payment instruments, while those households making more than $200,000 per year exhibit a very strong preference for credit cards. In fact, the preference for cash declines sharply once household income exceeds $25,000 per year, with debit cards cited as the preferred payment instrument for all those in household income groups between the two extremes.Interestingly, despite the declining preference for cash as income rises, all income groups use cash approximately the same number of times a month (22 times) regardless of income. The difference is that those making less than $25,000 annually use cash for a much wider variety of transactions, and for greater transaction amounts, than do those with higher household incomes.Consistent with this, the total value of low-income consumers’ cash spending, at $558 per month, is much higher than any other income group’s cash spending. Low income consumers also use cash for bill payments like housing more than the average consumer most likely due to a lack of access to mainstream banking services.6. Cash for SafetyOne additional reason why cash is king that was not covered by the Fed study is that consumers are becoming wary of the safety of debit and credit cards. In a study by Balance Innovations, only 39 percent of consumers were ‘very confident’ in the safety of plastic as a payment option. While the issue of safety was more prominent with older consumers, 52 percent of younger consumers were either ‘somewhat confident’ or ‘not confident’ in credit/debit safety.Could this be an indicator that cash transactions are actually on the rise? According to the study conducted after the Target data breach, 32 percent reported they would be using cash as a method of payment more frequently. Most interesting, 46 percent of the younger shoppers that claimed to be the most confident in credit and debit cards plan to use cash more, the highest level of any other age group.What’s NextSeveral studies provide evidence that cash continues to be a viable (if not preferred) payment option for all categories of consumers. While being the dominant payment option for the lowest value transactions, cash is also preferred for certain types of transactions and is the secondary choice for those that prefer cards or checks. Finally, low-income consumers will continue to be heavy cash users as long as mainstream banking alternatives are not available.And, while other digital payment alternatives continue to be promoted heavily, their impact on the marketplace to this point has been virtually non-existent.So, while the use of cash may be declining, we are far from a cashless society or one that will quickly embrace digital payments, especially for low ticket purchases. Until the financial community can provide an alternative that is as widely accepted, convenient and breach-proof as cash, dethroning cash as king will be difficult.;otherFinance;http://thefinancialbrand.com/
108;"IS THERE SUCH A THING AS HAVING TOO MUCH CASH? In many places the persistence of cash is symptomatic of a large informal economy. Such economies can only run on cash, and this preference for cash feeds, and is in turn fed by, bad behavior such as corruption and bribery. This bad behavior can be a substantial drag on the overall economy, suggesting that governments benefit by moving their citizenry away from cash. In recent years several countries, notably Korea, Mexico, and Argentina, have done just this, taking regulatory measures to persuade both buyers and sellers to reduce their use of cash. In this article we will look at the links between cash, bad behavior, and negative economic consequences, and conclude by discussing some of the solutions governments around the world have implemented to solve the problem of too much cash.Anyone who has ever negotiated a purchase knows why it might be preferable to pay for it with cash. Sellers often ask to be paid in cash because it constitutes an immediate transfer of funds that can be put to use right away. Because of this, sellers are often willing to lower their prices for buyers willing to pay cash. Cash also eliminates the risks associated with partial payments or credit, and it offers anonymity to both buyer and seller. The considerations above make a strong case, then, for using cash when buying stolen goods or when seeking to avoid giving the tax man his due, but for most of the purchases we make every day, considerations like financing and anonymity are rarely top of mind. For the vast majority of payments we make, how we choose to pay depends mainly on habit and convenience. Cash is almost always an option for payment (except when buying online), but its convenience often depends on how much of it you have in your wallet. Other factors, such as card rewards or purchase insurances offered on credit cards, mean that cash is very often the least beneficial payment instrument for the purchaser. Online shopping and online banking have fundamentally changed the way we buy things, suggesting that deeply ingrained purchasing habits can change. So why does so much cash usage persist?OCTOBER 2012          1ADVANCING INSIGHTS       ADVANCING COMMERCE.Global InsightsIS THERE SUCH A THING AS HAVING TOO MUCH CASH? In many places the persistence of cash is symptomatic of a large informal economy. Such economies can only run on cash, and this preference for cash feeds, and is in turn fed by, bad behavior such as corruption and bribery. This bad behavior can be a substantial drag on the overall economy, suggesting that governments benefit by moving their citizenry away from cash. In recent years several countries, notably Korea, Mexico, and Argentina, have done just this, taking regulatory measures to persuade both buyers and sellers to reduce their use of cash. In this article we will look at the links between cash, bad behavior, and negative economic consequences, and conclude by discussing some of the solutions governments around the world have implemented to solve the problem of too much cash.HEAVY CASH USAGE IS NOT RESTRICTED TO DEVELOPING MARKETSCountries around the world fall into four broad categories of cash usage patterns. Places such as Canada and the U.K. are examples of developed markets with low cash usage, while Germany and the U.S. are examples of developed markets with high cash usage. Places such as Australia, Turkey, and Korea are considered markets in transition, where regulatory measures impacting payment choice have been initiated. The final category, which includes the majority of the world’s countries and population, fall into the category of developing markets with high cash usage.CASH USAGE VARIES SUBSTANTIALLY EVEN WITHIN COUNTRY CATEGORIESThe charts below set out Advisors’ preliminary estimates of the percentage, by value, of consumer purchases that are made using cash in different countries around the world. The figures show that even in developed markets, where all the requisite infrastructure and incentives to move away from cash exist, cash use varies substantially. In some countries it accounts for less than 10% of all consumer payments, while in others the figure is greater than 40%.CASH AND CORRUPTION TRAVEL TOGETHERWith an idea of how prevalent cash use is on a country by country basis it becomes possible to observe correlations between cash usage and other points of known data. Looking at the level of cash usage alongside measures of corruption, a strong link emerges between the two. In many parts of the world, a preference for cash may be driven by a need for anonymity for payer and payee, in order to operate in economies where bribery is a part of everyday life.The tight correlation shown here offers the first piece of evidence that cash feeds, and is fed by, bad behavior. Corrupt officials don’t take credit cards for bribes, so the payments that grease the wheels in more venal economies may account in some part for the high prevalence of cash. The Global Corruption Perceptions Index develops its ratings by asking questions such as: “Do you trust the government?” and “Is corruption a big problem in your country?”; the lower the rating, the less the citizens trust their governments. In countries where mistrust is high, citizens may elect to operate primarily in cash and outside the formal economy because they do not wish to expose themselves to taxation, fines, or fees from corrupt officials.CASH-HEAVY ECONOMIES ARE HARDER PLACES TO DO BUSINESSIf cash begets (and is begotten by) corruption, then corruption appears to beget difficulties in doing business. Looking again at the estimates of cash as a percentage of consumer payments, we see a tight correlation between cash and the ease of doing business in the economies considered. Countries where it’s harder to do business appear to also be countries where consumers make more payments using cash. The World Bank calculates its Ease of Doing Business scores as a product of several other measurements of business difficulty. These include factors such as how hard it is to start a business, access to credit, enforceability of contracts, and insolvency laws. It is easy to imagine how getting credit or starting a business would be harder in more corrupt, cash-intensive economies. Credit and the ability to adjudicate credit are particularly hurt in cash-intensive economies, where data on revenues and even assets are faulty or nonexistent because so much of the economy happens in cash and off the books.USING CASH ISN’T NECESSARILY ABOUT AVOIDING TAXIn countries with consumption taxes, value-added taxes, or taxes on goods and/or services, cash payments are often used as a way to avoid paying these local levies. Higher taxes do not, however, appear to be correlated to higher cash usage. Cash intensive economies may have larger gray market economies, but this does not appear to be a result of higher taxes .The countries with more cash payments and larger gray markets (seen in Figure 5 as the countries with the larger bubbles to the right of the chart) do not appear to have larger average tax burdens than those with fewer cash payments and smaller gray markets (smaller bubble size/left of the chart). Indeed, many of these countries have substantially lower average tax burdens, suggesting that it is something other than a desire to avoid taxation that underpins the preference for cash. CASH-INTENSIVE ECONOMIES ARE LESS PRODUCTIVE PER CAPITABasic economics tell us that corruption and impediments to business will have a negative impact on the productivity of a given economy. This can also be observed in the direct correlation between cash usage and national per-capita GDP seen in Figure 6 below. This correlation between lower productivity and a preference for cash suggests that governments may want to investigate deeper into whether there are any causal links between the preference for cash and economic productivity. It may be worth considering the knock-on effects of a preference for cash when attempting to tally up the social and private costs of different payment instruments.CONCLUSIONSThere will always be a need for cash in some form. In places where infrastructures do not exist, or have been compromised, its portability and stored value can mean that cash is the only way to pay. Cash in some form is here to stay, whether we like it or not. So while there may be good reasons to ensure that we are always able to use cash, its predominance in some economies suggests that cash usage feeds, and is being fed by, bad behavior. The estimates of cash usage prepared for this paper suggest that cash usage in many economies far outstrips what would be expected of consumers making rational micro-economic choices, and inasmuch as cash seems to be facilitating bad behavior, this preference for cash is not a good thing.The information presented here can in no way be seen as implying any causation between cash usage and bad behavior. To blame bad behavior like corruption on a preference for cash would be like blaming high unemployment on too many job seekers. It would be blaming the symptoms for the disease. The most we can imply from the data reviewed is that a preference for cash appears, in many cases, to be symptomatic of broader economic problems and bad behavior. Data on the effect that reducing cash (i.e., through incentives such as M-Pesa or Boletazo) has had on this bad behavior are difficult to interpret and cannot be seen to imply a causal relationship between the two. This said, few governments that have undertaken initiatives to reduce the use of cash would question that they had had a positive overall effect on their economy";otherFinance;Mastercar Advisors - global insight
109;Faster and cheaper: Few economic victims in the “war on cash and checks” Few areas of payment technology are changing as rapidly as consumer-to-consumer transactions, also known as C2C. Here we define C2C payments as any payment made from one person to another for any purpose (to split a bill, to settle a debt, to give a gift, etc.) other than in exchange for goods and services. Because cash payments between individuals are virtually impossible to track, the exact size of the C2C payment market in the US is difficult to estimate. However, according to the most recent Federal Reserve Payments study, cash dominates C2C payments today, comprising 67% of transactions – with electronic payments making up just 9% of transactions. However, C2C payments in the US made through financial institutions or money transfer organizations have grown relatively quickly over the last several years – with value transferred reaching $92 bn in 2012 and growing at a CAGR of 26.4%. However, checks and other clearing mechanisms (including those provided by money transfer institutions) comprise nearly 80% of all transactions, followed by cash and book transfers, ACH, and credit/debit cards. About 60% of C2C transfers are originated in person (such as at a bank branch or money transfer agent), with about 30% of transfers occurring on a website and less than 5% on a mobile device.  ;otherFinance;The Future of Finance - Goldman sachs
110;Perhaps even more than technology, one of the most compelling changes impacting the payments industry is demographics. As technology evolves, so too does the comfort level of different demographics with the latest technology –  from PCs to mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, and from cash to plastic to mobile payments. As consumers age, they become wealthier – and this also impacts their spending capacity and credit worthiness. We examine some of the potentially disruptive effects of these shifts. Coming of Age: The story of Millennials, Gen X, and Baby Boomers Consumers’ financial habits change as they age. As they get older, personal income grows and personal wealth is gradually amassed – which drives differences in consumers’ interactions with banks over time. As a consumer’s relationship with a bank changes, changes in payment preferences follow. A 2013 study of US consumers by the US Federal Reserve yielded some surprising results. In contrast to the conventional wisdom that older consumers use far more cash because they are not conditioned to use electronic payments, younger consumers actually use the most cash (40% of transactions) relative to all other age groups – and among the demographics using the largest fraction of electronic payments is consumers ages 65 and up. Perhaps not surprisingly, consumers aged 65+ use credit cards nearly 5X more often than ages 18-24. However, debit card usage is far greater among consumers ages 18-34 (at 51%) relative to older consumers.  ;otherFinance;The Future of Finance - Goldman sachs
111;50% of the world population is without access to financial services Access to a bank account is one of the most basic needs in developed markets like US and Western Europe. However, the World Bank estimates that more than 50% of the global population (over the age of 15) does not have access to basic financial services. In many emerging markets, sizeable “shadow economies” exist which operate entirely on cash. These “shadow economies” comprise legal activities – including retail sales and employment – which are unreported or under-reported for the purposes of tax avoidance. ;otherFinance;The Future of Finance - Goldman sachs
112;"Banks Cash In on Surging Retailer Demand for 'Smart Safes'Banks are putting a high-tech spin on the oldest type of payment. And it is giving them a much-needed boost in fees.Cash — good, old-fashioned cash — remains the most popular way to pay, even as the industry tries to make transactions faster, phone-based and chip-enabled. And managing greenbacks is a big — and growing — business.Banks are making a big push to court retailers with large stacks of cash, including fast-food chains, gas stations and big-box stores. Regional banks, in particular, are expanding their ""smart safe"" business — a niche treasury product that retailers use to sort and remotely deposit dollar bills.""The usage of cash has not seen the decline that many would expect to see,"" said Bill Wasco, a senior executive for enterprise commercial payments at the banking unit of Cleveland-based KeyCorp. ""And what we do know is that cash, for all intents and purposes, is very commonly used for small-dollar transactions.""The push into cash automation comes as banks look for ways to generate fee income. Regional banks considerably expanded their noninterest sources of revenue in the second quarter, to make up for the revenue squeeze created by low interest rates.Several regional banks, including KeyCorp and PNC Financial Services Group, reported that fee income rose by nearly 10%,Ironically the rise of the smart safe coincides with the industry's rising investment in digital payments. Amid an industrywide clamor to make mobile wallets mainstream and satisfy the presumed preferences of younger consumers, cash still plays a key role, accounting for 40% of all transactions, according a recent study from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.The ""perception that young people don't use cash is actually wrong,"" said Barbara Bennett, a vice president in the cash product office at the San Francisco Fed. ""There is a very, very robust demand for cash.""Cash also accounts for a majority of small-dollar payments, primarily under $10, Bennett said.And that is creating a big — if unexpected — business opportunity for banks. ""Over the near term, cash is still the dominant vehicle for transactions, particularly for the markets we serve,"" said Bert Sciulli, senior vice president at the $340 billion-asset PNC, pointing to the ""gas-and-go types, and the Wawas of the [convenience store] world.""The focus on sales of smart safes is notable, particularly since the technology is not brand new. Banks of all sizes have offered them as a service for the past few years.Smart safes are primarily used to assist retailers with end-of-the-day deposits. The machines  — which look like large ATMs with touch screens on top — count and sort cash. They also automatically credit the money to customers' accounts, although the deposits have to be verified later. They are made by manufacturers such as Tidel and Armor Safe.Bankers say that retailers' desire to trim labor costs is driving the surge in demand. Cash may be popular with consumers, but, from a retailer's perspective, it can be time-consuming to manage. Counting it can be tedious, and scheduling frequent armored-car pickups can be expensive.""The marginal cost of handling cash is only going up,"" said John Bultema, head of treasury management at the $138 billion-asset Fifth Third Bancorp in Cincinnati. ""So why spend that time — that unproductive time — having valuable people do low-value-add activity?""In other cases the sheer volume of dollar bills used at large retail franchises is enough to justify the investment. ""The large merchants tell us that they have enough cash transactions that it makes sense for them to invest in some of these devices,"" Bennett said.So banks are, well, cashing in. Fifth Third has nearly 9,000 safes in the marketplace, mostly in the ""sweet spots"" of quick-service restaurants, convenience stores and sports facilities, Bultema said.The business generates just over $30 million per year, according to a bank spokesman, who declined to provide projections for the coming year. That figure equals about 1% of the bank's noninterest revenue last year.Fifth Third, like other banks, offers smart safes as a part of bundle of services. The bank leases the safe to retailers, and arranges for periodic pickups by armored cars. Clients pay for the service monthly.Part of the bank's product pitch is that, if issues arise, clients have ""only one throat to choke — just call the bank,"" Bultema said.PNC's smart-safe installations rose by 60% last year, said Sciulli said, declining to provide more specific figures on revenue or sales. He added that the Pittsburgh bank has seen an uptick in demand among health care providers, which are collecting more co-pays and other medical payments on site.Additionally, the $92 billion-asset KeyCorp — another Rust Belt regional — is getting into the game. The bank began offering smart safes in April, Wasco said.Smaller banks are also angling for a piece of the business. The $21 billion-asset Hancock Holding is planning to grow its smart-safe business in the coming year. The bank currently has 84 clients, but it hopes to expand by a clip of about 20 customers per year.The Gulfport, Miss., bank has recently noticed an interest among retailers in rural areas, where it is often inconvenient to drive to a bank branch every day, said Marc Bourn, a senior vice president at the bank.""It's not very big right now, but it's certainly something that we expect to grow,"" Bourn said.";otherFinance;http://www.americanbanker.com
113;"Cash is still tops for convenience, payment study findsAmerican consumers are tapping a wide variety of retail payment options these days, but while digital and mobile are gaining ground shoppers are still tethered to cash, debit cards and prepaid cards, new research shows.A survey of 1,000 shoppers and payment processes over  the past year found that: an overwhelming 93 percent of payments involved cash; 68 percent used debit cards and checks; 67 percent used credit cards; and 62 percent used Pay Pal.The study, ""How America Pays in 2015: Traditional, Digital and Mobile Convergence in Payments,"" was conducted by Blackhawk Network Shopper, and includes an infographic that can be viewed online.Blackhawk determined that cash and checks experienced the largest year-over-year declines among payment methods used, despite the fact that consumers ranked it as the most convenient form of payment at 93 percent (closely followed by credit cards at 92 percent).Mobile rated well in terms of perceived convenience for payments at 87 percent, however, only 25 percent of smartphone owners said they use a mobile wallet. Payment vehicles considered least convenient by survey participants were checks and bitcoin, at 38 percent and 35 percent, respectively.“Consumers still have a strong preference for traditional payment methods like debit cards and prepaid cards,"" Teri Llach, chief marketing officer at Blackhawk, said in a press release. ""Those payments tools are not going away anytime soon, even as interest in and usage of new payment methods grows. Our findings prove that payments is not either/or when it comes to legacy payments vs. emerging products; it’s really about convenience and providing a mix of options.""";otherFinance;/www.atmmarketplace.com
114;Today, consumers continue to make significant use of cash - it is real, instantaneous and perceived to be free. However, in reality cash payments are costly for society. Studies over the years have shown that the social cost of cash still remains considerable and the demand for cash continues to grow.The current SEPA landscape for the distribution and processing of cash is characterised by differing national infrastructures. This lack of harmonisation, common approach and sharing of best practice increases the cost of cash processing and creates inefficiencies across SEPA. In addition, recent EU legislation and decisions made by the European Central Bank (ECB) now need to be taken into consideration.All these developments lead to new challenges for commercial cash cycle participants in the various SEPA countries in order to optimise the general efficiency of their cash cycles.This document, compiled by the European Payments Council (EPC) together with the European Security Transport Association (ESTA) explains how a Balance Sheet Relief (BSR) mechanism (expansion of the NHTO concept - Notes Held To Order) may prove to be a valuable component for commercial cash cycle participants when evaluating their existing cycle. This mechanism reduces the financial cost of cash inventories and stimulates wholesale recirculation whilst reducing the operational involvement of the National Central Bank (NCB).The aim of this document is to highlight the different levels of responsibility of the NCB as well as the commercial cash cycle participants in a given model. Various cooperation structures that can be formed by these participants are also addressed in this document and widens the spectrum of potential improvements within the cash cycle.The partial delegation, total delegation and partial transfer models appear to provide a combination of the necessary elements to obtain the most efficient cash cycle model for the future and in particular, in such cases where the NCB decides to reduce its branch network, services and operating hours.These three models provide logistical cost optimization opportunities for the NCB and the commercial cash cycle participants and allows flexibility for developing customized cash services. In addition, they facilitate the direct exchange of excess cash among the different commercial participants. Finally, these models also achieve balance sheet relief for those commercial cash cycle participants involved. However, irrespective of the cash model (or combination of models) chosen, security of cash remains a key consideration when reviewing existing cash cycles.;otherFinance;EPC - Improving the efficiency of the handling of cash - Cash Cycle Models
115;"SEPA for Cash   One important objective of the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) initiative should be to encourage a shift from cash to electronic payments. Despite the fact that cash accounts for a falling proportion of retail payments, it is in general still the predominant payment method in Europe and the demand for cash continues to grow. Studies over the years have shown that the social cost of cash remains considerable. In October 2012, the European Central Bank (ECB) released the report 'The Social and Private Costs of Retail Payment Instruments' (see links below). The objective of this study is ""to enhance the general understanding of the social and private costs of different retail payment instruments from a European perspective, with the aim of helping policy-makers, banks and retailers promote efficient payments."" The ECB report analyses the social and private costs of making retail payments in 13 European countries and discovers that they are substantial, amounting to around 45 billion euros, or almost 1 percent of their combined gross domestic product. Due to the relatively high usage of cash, it accounts for nearly half of the total social costs.The European Payments Council (EPC) believes that actions by all stakeholders within the euro area could contribute towards reducing the high cost of processing and handling of cash.";otherFinance;EPC 
116;"Overall, the findings arefairly consistent and highlight that demographics play a major role across countries. Even whencontrolling for transaction size and other characteristics, we find that higher income and highereducation are associated with lower cash use.  Regarding age, we find that persons older than36 use significantly more cash than persons younger than 35. Also, the results provide supportfor  a  certain  habit  persistence  in  some  countries  (AT,  AU,  DE,  NL),  where  cash  increaseshomogeneously with age:  people aged 60 and older are more likely to use cash than peoplebetween 36 and 59.For three countries that collected data on consumer perceptions regarding payment instru-ments (AT, CA, and US), the perceived ease of using cash was highly significant and positive.This shows that consumers who rate cash high with regard to ease of use conduct more cashtransactions.  The perceptions regarding security were different, positive versus negative, be-tween AT and CA. The other perceptions with respect to cost and overall acceptance were notsignificant.  These results are in line with previous research;  see Schuh and Stavins (2010),Arango, Huynh, and Sabetti (2011), and von Kalckreuth, Schmidt, and Stix (2014b).The strongest effect on consumers’ choice between cash and non-cash was obtained fortransaction values, where the estimation results confirm that the probability of using cash de-creases homogeneously with the transaction value quartile. These results hold across all coun-tries. In the fourth transaction value quartile, the probability of using cash is lower by 42 (NL)to 63 pp (FR) relative to the first transaction value quartile.heresults alsoconfirman independent effect of purchase location/type of purchase.  Forexpenditures at gas stations and for purchases of semi-durables, the marginal effects were uni-versally negative (with the exception of NL), while for services, entertainment, and groceriesthey were positive. These results confirm previous results that were based on data from singlecountries (e.g., Klee, 2008; Cohen and Rysman, 2013).Another finding of the logit model is that people who hold higher cash balances on averageuse cash more often than people with lower cash balances.  Note, however, that we treat thisas indicative only because of the likely presence of reverse causality.25Although we tried toalleviate this issue by using average cash balances of individuals and not cash balances beforeeach transaction, we are aware that this does not completely solve the problem.  For deeperanalyses of this issue,  we refer to  Eschelbach and Schmidt  (2013),  Bouhdaoui and Bounie(2012),  and Arango,  Bouhdaoui,  Bounie,  Eschelbach,  and Hern _andez (2013),  who arrive atsimilar findings even when accounting for the possible endogeneity of cash balances.Several results from our descriptive analysis indicate that card acceptance is likely to beimportant in consumers’ choice between cash and non-cash. This result is reported in Table 9,which shows that the rate of acceptance of cards at the POS has a significant negative effect onthe probability of using cash (results are only available for AT, CA, DE, and, with limitations,NL). In order to understand the quantitative impact of this factor and to study by how muchit contributes to the level of cash usage across countries, we conduct a scenario analysis.  Inparticular, we compare the baseline probabilities, i.e., the observed frequencies from the datawith the hypothetical values obtained by assigning each person the maximum group acceptanceobserved in the sample.  Note that this does not necessarily mean that acceptance is raised toone, because this would imply a far stretch from reality.  Thus, the question we ask is by howmuch cash usage would decline if acceptance were as high as it is for the income/age groupthat reports the highest rate of acceptance.26Figure 6 summarizes the results for the first and fourth transaction value (TV) quartile. ForTV Q1, the effect on payment choice is trivial for AT, DE, and NL, while for CA it is significant.Thereis analmost10 percentage point increase in card usage for low-value transactions ifpayment  cards  were  universally  accepted.   However,  at  TV  Q4  the  effect  is  similar  acrosscountries, as the probability of card payment increases relative to cash. This would imply thatCanadians are more likely to pay with cards at all transactions if cards are universally accepted.High  acceptance  of  cards  will  only  increase  card  use  for  AT  and  DE  when  the  transactionvalues are high.  For NL, the effect would be minimal, which indicates that current levels ofacceptance are already relatively high at all transaction quartiles.  These results highlight thatcountry differences remain substantial.";otherFinance;ECB - Consumer Cash usage
117;"Many have predicted and espoused the view that cash is increasingly disappearing as a paymentinstrument; see Wolman (2012).  However, to paraphrase Mark Twain, we would say that thereports of the death of cash have been greatly exaggerated. This paper shows that in all sevencountries considered, cash is still used extensively – particularly for low-value transactions.In  some  European  countries  such  as  Austria  and  Germany,  cash  even  dominates  consumerpayment choices for all transaction values.This paper demonstrates that, apart from transaction sizes and consumer preferences forease of use, the use of cash is strongly correlated with demographics and point-of-sale char-acteristics such as merchant card acceptance and venue.  This largely confirms the results ofearlier studies that were based on data from only one or a small number of countries. Our find-ing that these results can be observed for all seven countries assures us that these are universalfactors driving cash use.Our paper signals the importance of cross-country differences. First, the level of cash usagediffers across the various countries. Second, differences can be found in the type of alternativesused for cash. Some countries often use credit cards as a substitute; in other countries, mainlydebit cards are used.  One explanation for these cross-country differences could be found indifferences in market structures and the pricing policies of retail payments.  Rysman (2009),for instance, highlights how market structure affects payments, or vice-versa. Third, we point atan important correlation between cash use and the amount of cash balances consumers carry.The direction of the correlation remains unclear.   Therefore,  as country differences are stillsubstantial, and given the remaining questions on the role and effect of cash balances, furtherwork is required to more fully ascertain the underlying drivers of consumers’ use of cash andalternative payment methods.";otherFinance;ECB - Consumer Cash usage
118;"CLS Group (CLS), a leading provider of risk mitigation and operational services for the global foreign exchange (FX) financial market infrastructure, and TriOptima, a leading provider of OTC derivatives post-trade and risk reduction services, announce today that they have launched the triReduce CLS Forward FX Compression Service completing the first successful compression cycle for FX forwards and swaps transactions.The new service combines CLS’s infrastructure and market connectivity with TriOptima’s triReduce compression product to enable counterparties to reduce the gross notionals of their outstanding portfolios without fundamentally changing their market positions.Launched at a time when international regulators have encouraged compression services for non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives, the triReduce CLS Forward FX Compression Service is designed to reduce operational, credit and counterparty risk for institutions and enhance capital efficiency. It is consistent with the goals of EMIR, Basel III and Dodd-Frank, all of which seek a more robust and transparent post-trade environment.Tobias Becker, Capital Management Trading at Credit Suisse, comments: ""Being able to compress FX forwards and swaps has the potential to not just simplify derivative portfolios and notionals but ultimately also to reduce counterparty exposure and costs. We welcome any initiative that helps increase the efficient management of FX derivatives in the marketplace.""David Puth, CEO of CLS, comments: “Trade compression is a vital tool in managing risk, leading to strong market demand for a compression service for FX forwards and swaps.“By combining CLS’s infrastructure, network and expertise in the FX market with TriOptima’s knowledge of the OTC derivatives environment and experience with compression in other asset classes, this new service enables institutions to efficiently reduce counterparty and credit exposure and to meet global regulatory requirements.”Peter Weibel, CEO of triReduce, TriOptima’s compression service, comments: “Working with CLS and its members underscores our commitment to providing robust and efficient compression services to a broad range of financial market participants. Adding FX forward compression is an important expansion of the asset classes in our catalogue of compression services.”";otherFinance;finextra
119;Deutsche Bank’s Research unit announced yesterday that it is launching a new set of proprietary foreign exchange (FX) positioning indices called CORAX (Categorised ORderflow from Autobahn FX).With the largest global share in electronic currency trading, Deutsche Bank is positioned to offer its clients the most representative, timely and accurate FX positioning report available in the market.CORAX indices will help to answer commonly asked questions such as: Are investors long or short a given currency? What is the current positioning by client type? Is positioning “stretched” or just beginning to build?The latest CORAX data shows that the main drivers behind this year’s dollar surge are asset managers, who have been buying close to record amounts of dollars. Hedge funds, in contrast, have been reducing dollar longs, suggesting that it is the behavior of real money, rather than hedge fund investors that will drive the next move in the dollar.David Folkerts-Landau, Chief Economist and Member of the Group Executive Committee at Deutsche Bank, said: “We are excited to be able to offer our clients the best foreign exchange positioning indices available anywhere. Including all G10 currencies and the most liquid currencies in emerging markets, CORAX is an example of the type of international market research that only a leading global bank can create.”Nicholas Weng, an FX strategist at Deutsche Bank and the creator of CORAX, said: “CORAX will be published with a one working day lag and is more comprehensive than other available products. We have managed to leverage Deutsche Bank’s position in foreign exchange whilst ensuring client confidentiality by a strict index construction process.”The unique combination of characteristics means CORAX positioning can supplement standard positioning metrics. The indices will be published every Wednesday in the CORAX Positioning Report. ;otherFinance;finextra
120;"The FSB today published a progress report on implementation of its September 2014 recommendations for reforms to foreign exchange (FX) benchmarks.This report draws on assessments of market participants’ progress which were undertaken by the main foreign exchange committees as well as by central banks in other large FX centres.One of the principal aims of the recommendations of the FX benchmarks report was to reduce the incentive and opportunity for improper trading behaviour by market participants around the benchmark fixes. The implementation to date of the FSB’s recommendations, together with the enhanced scrutiny externally and within organisations on fixing transactions, appears to have moved the market in a favourable direction.The overall assessment of this report is that there has been good progress in implementing many of the recommendations; however, in some cases progress has been mixed. In particular, the report re-emphasises that the FSB recommendations are intended to apply to all FX benchmarks, not just the WM/Reuters (WMR) 4pm London fix. A more complete implementation of the recommendations, particularly regarding other FX benchmarks, would increase the likelihood of maintaining and extending the improvement already seen. Regulators and FX market participants must remain focussed on achieving such an outcome. Key points from the report:Useful steps have been taken to reform the methodology of the widely used benchmark WM/Reuters (WMR) 4pm London fix, though there is scope for further progress on reforms in this area. Several central banks have also undertaken reviews of their processes for producing FX reference rates.Recommendations to support more transparency in customer pricing for fixing transactions have seen good implementation among the largest market participants and for the most used benchmarks, but elsewhere there is scope for further improvement. Similarly, steps to separate dealers’ fixings business from other activities are being taken by the larger participants and in the most active markets, but again there is room for further implementation in other areas of the FX market. For the execution of benchmark transactions, industry-led initiatives to promote greater use of independent netting and execution facilities are seeing welcome progress.Work is underway to improve market conduct practices, both within individual firms and through market-wide initiatives, including the global effort underway to develop a single code of conduct for the foreign exchange market through the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Markets Committee working group on FX markets.While many index providers and end-users have increased their focus on the due diligence around FX benchmark use, there is scope for greater follow-through on this on the part of some market participants.The report published today also includes an empirical analysis of the behaviour of the FX market around the London 4pm fixing window following WMR’s changes to the window in February 2015, and compares it to that prevailing before the changes which were described in the earlier report. A noteworthy development is the increased share of trading during the fixing window that uses algorithmic execution.The FSB will continue to monitor progress in this area, and work with authorities and industry bodies as needed to ensure continued enhancements to FX benchmarks and related activity.

122;USForex Launches Mobile App for High-Value TransactionsIt’s a simple matter to send $20 on your mobile phone now — options abound. But what about when you want to send $10 thousand?USForex has had a mobile app for a while, but it was purely informational. Now users can send money internationally with a few taps of their tablet or smartphone.What’s unusual about this is that the USForex mobile app is for high-value transactions — its typical users are affluent individuals and treasury managers at corporations. The minimum transaction size is $1,000 U.S., with no upper limit.The app update with the enhanced functionality went live at the end of July for both Android and iOS.No money is actually sent using the app, according to David Nicholls, head of alliance partnerships at USForex. Instead, a user wishing to send $10,000 to Australia moves the money from his bank account to USForex, which deposits it in its U.S. bank. The customer then receives a live quote of the exchange rate, which Nicholls said is better than banks offer, and at lower fees.Then in Australia, (where the company began life as OzForex) money is withdrawn from an Australian bank account and sent to the recipient. The most common uses are buying property overseas, or making rent payments.OzForex, the parent company, has been in the peer-to-peer money transfer space since 1998. It has sent $50 billion in U.S. currency during that span.Last year the company transacted more than $12 billion in international money transfers, Nicholls said. “We have documented a 261% rise in users wanting to transact on mobile,” Nicholls said. “By the end of this year, we expect fully 50% of our transactions to be on mobile devices.” Tablets are popular for its users, but smartphones are more popular, Nicholls said.Isn’t sending large amounts of money over mobile devices risky? Nicholls said the company’s security measures are just as rigorous on mobile devices as on desktop computers. “Our customers are busy people,” Nicholls said. “They don’t want to be tied to a computer.”;otherFinance;http://bankinnovation.net
123;"Chinese RMB Will Become Tradable Without Restrictions in 5 Years’ Time: Study Despite worries in recent weeks about China’s economy and the process of reform, around two-thirds (63%) of senior executives from financial services companies in China, and more than three-quarters of those offshore (78%) think that the renminbi (RMB) will become fully convertible and tradable without restrictions in around five years’ time.Majorities of both groups believe it will take only slightly longer (7-10 years) for the RMB to become a global investment currency.Moreover, 60% of China respondents believe the RMB will surpass the US dollar as the world’s most commonly used currency within the next decade and 94% of say that this will happen eventually. Among global respondents, one in five think the dollar’s pre-eminence will be challenged within 10 years and 45% think this will happen eventually.These are among the key findings of ""A Delicate Stage: The Future of the Renminbi as a Global Investment Currency,"" a new report published by The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), sponsored by UK Trade & Investment.The report is based on a survey of 202 senior executives from major financial services companies, 102 headquartered in mainland China and 100 outside it. The survey was conducted in August 2015, as confidence in China’s economic stability was hit by a massive stock market selloff and the authorities’ steps to counter it, as well as the sudden devaluation of the RMB’s reference rate.Restrictive regulations are the most commonly cited problem in handling the currency by both on- and offshore financial services companies. A lack of liquidity and offshore risk-management products rank second and third.Doubtless influenced by the events of the summer, financial institutions in China put “less government intervention in onshore equity markets” at the top of their list of urgently required policy reforms, while for global respondents it is in second place, behind liberalisation of the legal services market and judicial reform.“We remain committed to liberalising [China’s markets], but might still need some control,” says Yao Yudong, director general of the PBOC’s Research Institute of Finance and Banking. “We don’t really have a framework [for the internationalisation of the RMB]. It’s really driven by market forces... We are shifting from RMB use in trade settlement toward other assets, and the RMB is gradually being regarded as a reserve currency, which depends more on things like local interest rates and whether we can give better returns for investors.”Financial services firms expect full RMB convertibility in around five years; most Chinese firms see it overtaking the US dollar.";otherFinance;CFO innovation
124;The WeSwap website allows international travellers to trade spare currency directly online High quality global journalism requires investment.WeSwap is a currency exchange website that enables people travelling internationally to trade their spare currency with one another directly online, thus avoiding conventional bank fees. It claims to be the world’s first person-to-person currency exchange for travellers.Users swap currency with each other at the interbank exchange rate and pay a transaction fee. As well as an online account that can hold multiple currencies, users receive the WeSwap Prepaid MasterCard, which lets them access the funds in their account anywhere that accepts MasterCard. If a user introduces another person to the service, they can swap currency between each other for free. High quality global journalism requires investment. By circumventing banks and retail outlets, WeSwap can afford to charge travellers 1 per cent of the value of the cash being exchanged. This is far less than the 13 per cent charged by some currency exchange services, according to the founders.WeSwap’s terms and conditions state that it reserves the right to run anti-money laundering and anti-fraud checks on each account registration.The London-based business was created by former currency traders Jared Jesner and Simon Sacerdoti in 2010 and now employs 14 people.Although the service has been open to the public for only a few months, Mr Jesner says it has attracted hundreds of users from 10 countries.However, while the marketplace grows, not all users will be able to find buyers for their currency, Mr Jesner admits. In those cases, WeSwap has pledged to swap any remaining amounts itself at a better-than-market rate.The founders raised £810,000 in 2012 and a further £1.15m last year to grow operations. The first £300,000 came from friends and family, with the remaining funds raised from angel investors.;otherFinance;Financial Timesft.com/
125;"World Finance: The current volatility and fluctuation in global currencies have boosted the popularity of investing in the foreign exchange market. With me to speak about how best to navigate this industry is Ghassan Elias Kteily, AGM/Chief Growth Officer for ROYAL Forex Trading.Well Ghassan, the forex market. Tell me about the opportunities and indeed the challenges that represents?Ghassan Elias Kteily:  The abundance, if you like, or the approachability of the foreign exchange market makes it easy to trade. And a factor that really adds to that and enhances trading, is the low margin – that’s the leverage. The low margin, which is as low as one percent, and sometimes a quarter of a percent or half of a percent, enables you to trade 200 times your money.It gives the opportunity to speculators to trade with very little money, big amounts and volume of foreign exchange. However, it increases the risks and rewards – so this is an opportunity and it is a challenge at the same time.Well ROYAL is a global financial trading brand and you offer your services through headquarters in both Beirut and Sydney but when it comes to trading and data security, how do you deal with different jurisdictions?Ghassan Elias Kteily:  We chose to be fully regulated in both jurisdictions in Lebanon by the CMA, which is the Capital Markets Authority; and in Australia by ASIC, which is the Australian Securities and Investment Commission.So when we talk about data security, we are talking about protection against cyber attacks. Companies like ROYAL through adhering to the requirements of the regulators – that is segregating the clients funds, putting in place proper risk management strategies, meeting with all the liquidity ratios – do guarantee that funds are secure, and that clients can worry about trading in the markets, not about their funds being secure or not with ROYAL and other companies.World Finance: And those trading in the Middle Eastern markets differ from that of the west?Ghassan Elias Kteily:  The Middle East’s investors are as sophisticated as they are in the rest of the world. However, eight countries in the GCC and in the Middle East have their currencies pegged to the dollar.So for them, currencies are pegged, and there isn’t much uncertainty over there. People tend to trade commodities instead: oil, gold, silver and so on and so forth.Trading commodities is more risky than trading currencies. And Middle Eastern investors work on a tactical, not a strategic basis. And that’s what makes their trading more short-term and abrupt: so, quick trade will come out. While with the European investor, you’ll find that they will take a strategic position, like with equities, and leave it for a longer-term.World Finance: And when it comes to regulation, how stringent is your industry?Ghassan Elias Kteily:  Very stringent. Regulators have opted for stipulating and dictating more rigid parameters and benchmarks that will regulate the industry. And accordingly, they have imposed higher margins, more capital requirements, higher ratio requirements, to ensure that companies stay on the safe side. Consequently, the investors, the clients, and their moneys are safer.World Finance: Transparency is of course a huge issue, how do you approach this?Ghassan Elias Kteily: Transparency relates to many aspects. There is trading transparency: that is, what you demonstrate on your website. You have to advertise and promote what you really do offer – you have to be totally transparent with clients regarding spreads, fees, commissions, the depth of the liquidity you have. And in volatile markets clients will be concerned very much about having their orders executed.And this what you should be transparent about. Basically, advertising honestly and transparently how much you can help the client transact his transaction and his business through you as a company.World Finance: Now finally, we have seen the Chinese stock market having quite an impact on markets worldwide, so what other trends do you foresee impacting your industry over the coming months?Ghassan Elias Kteily: What I foresee is that moving forward for the next 18-24 months, emerging markets and developing countries that are the major partners to China, like Brazil and other Latin American countries and some east European countries, which basically export steel and copper and wood to China; as the Chinese economy slows down, they are bound to be affected.Their currencies are going to be affected because if you export less, to the second largest economy in the world, that means you are earning less foreign currency.Likewise, it will affect their capital markets because their borrowing power will be less, you have to borrow at a higher rate and that means spending more, and that means, your capital market locally will be affected adversely as well.";otherFinance;worldfinance.com
126;European Startups Form Lobby Group To Push On EU Digital PolicyA group of European tech companies have formed a lobby group with the aim of furthering the interests of homegrown digital companies by working to shape regional policy to better help local startups scale up.The group also wants to offer an alternative — i.e. local — perspective to the U.S. tech giants who typically dominate the digital lobbying landscape in Brussels.Member businesses span various tech areas — from e-commerce, to security, to mobile gaming — with the 25 initial members including the likes of BlaBlaCar, Spotify and SwiftKey. The group’s founder and president is Skype co-founder and Atomico founder and CEO Niklas Zennström.“We have formed an alliance to share our collective experience with policymakers and challenge mindsets about Europe, technology, and the Internet,” said Zennström in a statement.“There are so many European tech company success stories. We think we will be able to help European leaders understand that Europe is good at tech and show how policymakers can clear the way for the tech industry to grow further.”The initiative, which is called the European Technology Alliance, was announced today at an event attended by Andrus Ansip, the European Commission’s VP who is heading up the Digital Single Market (DSM) strategy — aka the big European political initiative the Alliance is hoping to shape with its input in the near term. The EC is currently consulting on priorities and standards for the DSM.“We share the political aims for embracing digitisation with confidence. We also share pride in Europe’s digital capacities,” said Ansip speaking at the launch, and noting that the aim of the DSM strategy is to remove barriers to digital growth — such as regional market fragmentation — which he asserted have been preventing European startups from scaling up to become “global companies”.“My door is open. Tell us what is needed and if our direction is the right one,” Ansip added.A spokesman for the Alliance, Fabrizio Porrino of Italian business FacilityLive, told TechCrunch the group has not yet established common policy positions at this nascent stage. Formalizing the way it is run, reviewing new member requests and establishing things like vote metrics will be the first order of business, as it works to agree on those common positions to lobby for. Funding has also not been formalized at this point, with member companies contributing “what they can” to get things up and running.“The Alliance is being formed because there was a request come in from the Commission. The issue is nowadays in Brussels you already have many so-called lobby groups that are somehow European but when you look at the membership many of them — they are 90 or 80 per cent run by American or non-European companies,” said Porrino.“So the issue is for credibility. We are not saying that these companies should not be trusted but these companies they grow elsewhere… We want to get a different story. It’s a group of companies that were born in Europe. So they’ve faced all the problems that we have or may not have in Europe. And then from Europe you went global. So it’s a totally different angle [vs tech companies that scaled up outside Europe].”“I’m not sure that a company that was born in the U.S. knows how to make it in Europe,” he added. “This is the main point of the Alliance. We are putting together everybody’s experience on the table, we’re going to share experience, we’re going to tell how we made it, how we’re becoming global.”To become a member of the alliance, a company must be “European in origin” and “perceived as a European company”, as Porrino put it. “Not anybody can join.”Porrino said it will be running internal working groups to discuss policy points and see if it can establish common positions to put in front of European politicians.“At the moment there is momentum that has been created before [via other EU initiatives such as The Startup Manifesto] and because also institutions they have understood that if you want to be a global player, and does not want to be just a follower, it has to create its own industrial base, its own digital economy base,” he added.;otherFinance;techcrunch.com
127;"The business model followed by traditional banks must changeThere's been a lot of tweeting of a few lines in an interview that I gave recently in Spain for BBVA's innovation centre.  As a result, I thought I would post the interview here and will reveal the line that gets all the tweets in the next week or so.Chris Skinner: “The business model followed by traditional banks must change”Chris Skinner, a British expert on financial issues, was in Madrid on September 18 to take part in Innomoney, an event organized by Adigital on Fintech and the financial technology revolution. It was a whirlwind visit, during which the financial advisor and authority on payment method innovation cautioned that digital transformation is the only sure path to survival in the banking market. He also found time to give this interview with the BBVA Innovation Center. Are traditional banks aware of the threat posed by fintech banking?The banks that I speak to increasingly have the issue on their radar. I think Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan Chase, illustrated it best when he highlighted the issue in a letter to shareholders during the first quarter of this year. Since then everyone has been aware of it. I think the problem that most banks have is that they don't know how to deal with the threat.What should banks do?As I said in my speech [Chris Skinner had given a conference at Innomoney some hours before], traditional banks face the challenge, and it's an enormous one, of changing from physical infrastructure based on paper distribution to a digital infrastructure based on data distribution. This means changing the banking business model from the top down, as the Internet now supports financial operations, and that is what Fintech is all about. Traditional banks have branches and employees that will have to be relocated to other services or roles.Is it a challenge?Absolutely. The challenge facing traditional banks is to make progress towards digital structures, and to do this they need to rethink the current model. A good indication that change is needed can be found just by booking at the majority of bank executives, in particular CEOs, who tackle financial tasks such as risk management and regulations based on accounting backgrounds; but they have no grasp of, or training in, technology. The exception to the rule is Francisco González, Chairman of BBVA, who began his career as an IT programmer and understands the important role that technology plays in operations. I think this is why we are seeing other Spanish banks, such as Santander and Sabadell, moving more rapidly toward digital structure, while in the UK, in contrast, we find no executive or leader with a tech background.Will technology bring savings for banks?Just imagine! If people connect directly via software or a server, the spread between a person who has money and someone who needs it is 50 bps, while if we factor in human resources, buildings, branches, risk management, all the paper forms, controls and verifications... then said cost is statistically 200 bps or more. In short, the new players are offering and making money at half the cost of traditional players. Should we fear the financial revolution?I hold that the business model followed by traditional banks must change. And that doesn't mean people losing their jobs, as branch staff can provide just as good customer service on Facebook. It's not about them being laid off. As was said this week on the BBC in a program about artificial intelligence, more jobs have been created over the last 50 years thanks to technology than have been destroyed.The concern is not the loss of jobs. We need to understand what new role people will have to play and the infrastructure that is required in a technological world. Traditional banks, and a good example is MetroBank in the United Kingdom, need to integrate their value systems. When there are hundreds of technological parts, banks need to develop both internal and external controls and bring the parts together in order to further drive progress.";otherFinance;thefinanser.co.uk/
128;Cash is Going Extinct, Unless You Pay to Protect ItAnd so the war on cash begins with its first casualties: Swiss pension funds and large depositors at banks worldwide are beginning to feel the impact of negative interest rates, which have the potential to unravel the global economy.First casualtiesSwiss pension funds are under attack by the very central bank that should be protecting the prosperity of its people, the Swiss National Bank (SNB). The SNB has cut rates so low that from a nominal level they have breached the zero lower band, resulting in an essentially negative rate. This has caused Swiss pension funds to begin to withdraw cash from the bank and store it in a vault since now the cost of carry is greater than cold hard storage of cash.With negative interest rates, Swiss pension funds now have the honor of paying the bank to hold their cash for them. One Pension fund manager calculated he would save CHF 25,000 per year on every CHF 10 million by withdrawing it from a bank and putting it into vault storage. Yes you read that right!Negative interest rates are simply a tool to get banks to loan out money and help stimulate the economy. Pushing interest rates below the level of inflation by central banks should theoretically stimulate growth as borrowing becomes cheaper but it has also had the reverse effect of making risk-averse individuals and investors go far out on the spectrum in search for yields. The Financial Times describes this new phenomenon:“Welcome to the Alice in Wonderland world of negative interest rates, a topsy-turvy universe where central bankers are so alarmed at the prospect of weak inflation that they have cut borrowing costs below zero, in effect charging financial institutions to leave their accounts in the black.”Not Just a Swiss ThingPension funds in Switzerland are not the only ones to be feeling the affects of negative interest rates. JP Morgan has told large depositors that they would be charging a “balance sheet utilization fee” of 1% a year on deposits in excess of the money they need for operations. The goal is to get rid of US$100 billion in deposits and the targeted customers are other financial institutions.In essence, this becomes a negative interest rate on these deposits. In other words, it is more expensive for banks to pay interest to depositors than hold their money due to extremely low interest rates and the cost and laws behind new regulations.“Because large, uninsured deposits would be expected to leave most quickly, the rules will now require that banks maintain reserves for those deposits that they cannot use for profitable activities like making loans,” writes Emily Glazer of the WSJ. “That makes it much less efficient or profitable for banks to hold these deposits.” JP Morgan is not the only bank that has this problem others include: Citigroup, HSBC, Deutsche Bank, and Bank of America. In other words, welcome to the world of forced vault storage of cash.War on CashLower commodity prices, stagnant wage growth, low returns on savings and low GDP growth in developed economies are all signs of the one word that scares central banks – deflation. Central bankers believe negative interest rates can fix this, and many think they should go even lower to help stimulate economic growth. Physical paper money is a big problem in this sense because it is an alternative for customers who want to withdraw their deposits (like pension funds and store in a vault).“Physical paper money provides the check against negative interest rates for if they become too great, people will simply withdraw their funds and hoard cash,” says economist Martin Armstrong. “Furthermore, paper currency allows for bank runs. Eliminate paper currency and what you end up with is the elimination of the ability to demand to withdraw funds from a bank.”Electronic currency also transfers complete control of the money supply to the central banks to implement whatever policies they desire. Armstrong further explains why central banks dislike physical cash:“Paper currency is indeed the check against negative interest rates. We need only look to Switzerland to prove that theory. Any attempt to impose say a 5% negative interest rates (tax) would lead to an unimaginably massive flight into cash. This was already demonstrated recently by the example of Swiss pension funds, which withdrew their money from the bank in a big way and now store it in vaults in cash in order to escape the financial repression. People will act in their own self-interest and negative interest rates are likely to reduce the sales of government bonds and set off a bank run as long as paper money exists.”Cold, Hard Cash as a Store of Value not a Medium of ExchangeNew federal rules penalize banks for holding deposits that are prone to flee during a crisis or stressed environment. This essentially is any depositor (including other banks) who is over the FDIC insurance limit of US$250,000, making this policy a potent weapon in the war on cash. Therefore, most large depositors don’t hold their money in a savings account but in highly rated bonds as a preferred store of wealth. These bonds have super low yields, which essentially come out to be the cost of storage to hold them at large institutions. This, in turn, takes large amounts of cash out of circulation and not used as a medium of exchange, but a store of value. As has been noted in previous articles, this has decreased the supply of bonds, particularly safe bonds, in the market. Highly rated corporate bond inventories have dropped dramatically in the US and Europe (75% and 50% respectively) and demand for these bonds has risen. This has driven the price and the yields to drop dramatically to a point where they are negative once the cost of the newly implemented deposit fees is taken into account.Stricter regulations have also caused banks to keep more bonds on their balance sheets. In other words, cash is going extinct, unless you pay to protect it.The Liquidity ParadoxLiquidity paradox is a term coined by Citibank analyst Matt King to explain Central Bank policies of QE and extreme easing, which has herded investors into risky assets to get returns at a better rate than near 0%. According to Citi, this has caused “large scale mismatches in the number of buyers and sellers.” This has resulted in investors all investing in the same manner in the search for returns giving rise to the liquidity paradox:“[…] because the more liquidity central banks add, the higher the risk of a serious liquidity crunch -  started out in corporate bond markets but is now distorting government bond, currency and share markets. It says while the post-financial crisis crackdown on own-account trading by investment houses was partly to blame for a decline in professional market-making, the increased difficulty of finding buyers because everyone is selling at once owes more to central banks' hold on financial markets since the crisis.”A New Era for BankingThese policies have led to distortions in the capital markets and most people investing in the same way (herd-like investing) exacerbating the liquidity problem. Unwinding these trades is going to be problematic due to the massive one-sided trading.Welcome to the new era of banking where banks will only accept money if customers are willing to pay for this “privilege”. Access to capital markets is being eroded and paper money is being faded out. When will enough be enough? Who would ever have thought that banks would shun cash and that the old-school vault and storage businesses would be a part of this “new economy.” ;otherFinance;cointelegraph.com
129;"Fintech startups learn one thing at a very early age — to make it in the real world, they have to solve a real-world problem.This year's crop of tech companies to watch includes clusters of companies trying to solve some of banks' biggest headaches, including slow mobile onboarding, sluggish loan processes and the challenge of authenticating customers whom institutions never see in person.Onboarding ChallengesHow to shorten the time it takes to become a new customer on a smartphone app or mobile browser is among the questions banks are increasingly trying to answer as branch transactions continue to decline.They have work to do. Digital abandonment rates, after all, are estimated at upward of 80%, according to a study published in April by Mobile Strategy Partners, a firm that sells mobile account opening technology.That troubling number is chalked up to the time-sucking account opening experiences often in place for on-the-go consumers. Some institutions still require consumers to mail in documents or visit their branches while trying to sign up for accounts on smartphones. Other institutions make the task hard by repurposing forms created for desktop banking.Sure, some consumers are motivated to go through a desktop-oriented onboarding experience on a mobile device. But the laborious process is also what can and does prevent consumers from becoming customers, said David Gerbino, a fintech consultant and former community banker.""There is no reason why every single bank and every single credit union can't have a mobile-account-opening process,"" said Gerbino, who believes onboarding is supposed to also include elements that help get people engaged with the product, such as setting up bill pay, just as much as earning their business. ""If one can do it, they can all do it."" Many banks are coming to realize their overwhelming onboarding processes are getting in the way of acquiring customers at a time when many young adults expect nothing less than a few clicks of a button to complete a task.USAlliance Federal Credit Union, for instance, had a paper process that took upward of 30 minutes to sign up for an account in person. It also took 10 minutes online to become a member through an experience that the institution readily acknowledges wasn't the best.So with help from Gro Solutions, the Rye, N.Y. institution now has an account-opening process that takes less than four minutes to complete on a mobile app or mobile-optimized web page as USAlliance works to become a mobile-first brand -- even in its branches. Employees in its 22 branches and at live events roam around with tablets to sign consumers up for accounts with the improved mobile experience.Several young firms in our Companies to Watch, including Avoka, Gro Solutions, a subsidiary of Mobile Strategy Partners, Fenergo and Trunomi are offering answers to this conundrum, while another — ZenBanx — is already letting consumers use their smartphone cameras to input data instead of typing out the info needed to become customers of the digital-only account.";otherFinance;www.americanbanker.com
130;"As America’s economic supremacy fades, the primacy of the dollar looks unsustainableIF HEGEMONS are good for anything, it is for conferring stability on the systems they dominate. For 70 years the dollar has been the superpower of the financial and monetary system. Despite talk of the yuan’s rise, the primacy of the greenback is unchallenged. As a means of payment, a store of value and a reserve asset, nothing can touch it. Yet the dollar’s rule has brittle foundations, and the system it underpins is unstable. Worse, the alternative reserve currencies are flawed. A transition to a more secure order will be devilishly hard.For decades, America’s economic might legitimised the dollar’s claims to reign supreme. But, as our special report this week explains, a faultline has opened between America’s economic clout and its financial muscle. The United States accounts for 23% of global GDP and 12% of merchandise trade. Yet about 60% of the world’s output, and a similar share of the planet’s people, lie within a de facto dollar zone, in which currencies are pegged to the dollar or move in some sympathy with it. American firms’ share of the stock of international corporate investment has fallen from 39% in 1999 to 24% today. But Wall Street sets the rhythm of markets globally more than it ever did. American fund managers run 55% of the world’s assets under management, up from 44% a decade ago.The widening gap between America’s economic and financial power creates problems for other countries, in the dollar zone and beyond. That is because the costs of dollar dominance are starting to outweigh the benefits.First, economies must endure wild gyrations. In recent months the prospect of even a tiny rate rise in America has sucked capital from emerging markets, battering currencies and share prices. Decisions of the Federal Reserve affect offshore dollar debts and deposits worth about $9 trillion. Because some countries link their currencies to the dollar, their central banks must react to the Fed. Foreigners own 20-50% of local-currency government bonds in places like Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, South Africa and Turkey: they are more likely to abandon emerging markets when American rates rise.At one time the pain from capital outflows would have been mitigated by the stronger demand—including for imports—that prompted the Fed to raise rates in the first place. However, in the past decade America’s share of global merchandise imports has dropped from 16% to 13%. America is the biggest export market for only 32 countries, down from 44 in 1994; the figure for China has risen from two to 43. A system in which the Fed dispenses and the world convulses is unstable.A second problem is the lack of a backstop for the offshore dollar system if it faces a crisis. In 2008-09 the Fed reluctantly came to the rescue, acting as a lender of last resort by offering $1 trillion of dollar liquidity to foreign banks and central banks. The sums involved in a future crisis would be far higher. The offshore dollar world is almost twice as large as it was in 2007. By the 2020s it could be as big as America’s banking industry. Since 2008-09, Congress has grown wary of the Fed’s emergency lending. Come the next crisis, the Fed’s plans to issue vast swaplines might meet regulatory or congressional resistance. For how long will countries be ready to tie their financial systems to America’s fractious and dysfunctional politics?That question is underscored by a third worry: America increasingly uses its financial clout as a political tool. Policymakers and prosecutors use the dollar payment system to assert control not just over wayward bankers and dodgy football officials, but also errant regimes like Russia and Iran. Rival powers bridle at this vulnerability to American foreign policy.Americans may wonder why this matters to them. They did not force any country to link its currency to the dollar or encourage foreign firms to issue dollar debt. But the dollar’s outsize role does affect Americans. It brings benefits, not least cheaper borrowing. Alongside the “exorbitant privilege” of owning the reserve currency, however, there are costs. If the Fed fails to act as lender of last resort in a dollar liquidity crisis, the ensuing collapse abroad will rebound on America’s economy. And even without a crisis, the dollar’s dominance will present American policymakers with a dilemma. If foreigners continue to accumulate reserves, they will dominate the Treasury market by the 2030s. To satisfy growing foreign demand for safe dollar-denominated assets, America’s government could issue more Treasuries—adding to its debts. Or it could leave foreigners to buy up other securities—but that might lead to asset bubbles, just as in the mortgage boom of the 2000s.It’s all about the BenjaminsIdeally America would share the burden with other currencies. Yet if the hegemony of the dollar is unstable, its would-be successors are unsuitable. The baton of financial superpower has been passed before, when America overtook Britain in 1920-45. But Britain and America were allies, which made the transfer orderly. And America came with ready-made attributes: a dynamic economy and, like Britain, political cohesiveness and the rule of law (see article).Compare that with today’s contenders for reserve status. The euro is a currency whose very existence cannot be taken for granted. Only when the euro area has agreed on a full banking union and joint bond issuance will those doubts be fully laid to rest. As for the yuan, China’s government has created the monetary equivalent of an eight-lane motorway—a vast network of currency swaps with foreign central banks—but there is no one on it. Until China opens its financial markets, the yuan will be only a bit-player. And until it embraces the rule of law, no investor will see its currency as truly safe.All this suggests that the global monetary and financial system will not smoothly or quickly wean itself off the greenback. There are things America can do to shoulder more responsibility—for instance, by setting up bigger emergency-swaplines with more central banks. More likely is a splintering of the system, as other countries choose to insulate themselves from Fed decisions by embracing capital controls. The dollar has no peers. But the system that it anchors is cracking";otherFinance;http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21669875-americas-economic-supremacy-fades-primacy-dollar-looks-unsustainable-dominant-and?zid=295&ah=0bca374e65f2354d553956ea65f756e0
131;Bank to the Futurebacktothefuture_DayI  just returned from 10 enjoyable days with family and friends in three U.S. cities (1). I’m still amazed at how the smartphone has made traveling so much easier. Text messaging (especially with speech-to-text), Google maps, Yelp, Uber, Expedia, Alaska Airlines, Siri and more. If only the battery would hold out all day, it would be nearly perfect.But one area that still lags is personal finance. Sure, you can get your bank balance or transfer cash on your phone 24/7, but I could do that in 1985 through an 800-number. Where’s the Back to the Future stuff?It will be here sooner than you think.Had the worldwide financial system not teetered on the brink less than seven years ago, we’d have all kinds of financial hover boards and self-lacing shoes. But there were a few other projects that had priority, like righting the ship.But with that mostly behind us, we should see real progress in the next few years. Here are five Bank to the Future predictions for 2020 (or sooner). The basic technology for each is already available and has been on stage at Finovate and/or FinDEVr:1.Financial travel guard: Automatically alerts card issuers and banks to your exact location, which is fed into authorization algorithms to ensure approvals wherever you go. And tokenization masks your card numbers from dishonest or careless shopkeepers.2.Annotated spending storybook: Sure, you can look back at your pictures from four years ago to help remember the name of that ice cream shop you visited. But with spending location, annotations (including your photos or receipts) and extensions (such as Yelp integration), your “story” as told through transactions is readily accessible in a searchable database accessed with a few keystrokes or voice commands. Of course, there’s a map view, too.3.Family integration: Adding family members to your account should be like connecting on social media, not going through an FBI background check. We’ll need some support from the regulators, but we’ll get there eventually. And once connected, it should be easy to share funds, co-sign loans, manage savings and get everyone’s finances in sync like Dropbox, Evernote or iCloud (although that last one perhaps shouldn’t be the model).4.No. More. Passwords: Username/password authentication is a pesky holdover from the 1980s. Biometrics and device identification will rule very soon.5.Real-time insurance: Granted, this will take longer than five years, but the future will have on-demand insurance. Like calling on Uber, if you decide you want a little extra protection for your car, for your business, for the guests at your party, you just select the right button, turn the dial, and order it up. Pricing will be transparent and real-time. There may be “surge fare” premiums, but that’s part of the on-demand model.;otherFinance;http://finovate.com/bank-to-the-future/?utm_source=feedblitz&utm_medium=FeedBlitzEmail&utm_content=646536&utm_campaign=0
132;"The business model followed by traditional banks must changeThere's been a lot of tweeting of a few lines in an interview that I gave recently in Spain for BBVA's innovation centre.  As a result, I thought I would post the interview here and will reveal the line that gets all the tweets in the next week or so.Chris Skinner: “The business model followed by traditional banks must change”Chris Skinner, a British expert on financial issues, was in Madrid on September 18 to take part in Innomoney, an event organized by Adigital on Fintech and the financial technology revolution. It was a whirlwind visit, during which the financial advisor and authority on payment method innovation cautioned that digital transformation is the only sure path to survival in the banking market. He also found time to give this interview with the BBVA Innovation Center. Are traditional banks aware of the threat posed by fintech banking?The banks that I speak to increasingly have the issue on their radar. I think Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan Chase, illustrated it best when he highlighted the issue in a letter to shareholders during the first quarter of this year. Since then everyone has been aware of it. I think the problem that most banks have is that they don't know how to deal with the threat.What should banks do?As I said in my speech [Chris Skinner had given a conference at Innomoney some hours before], traditional banks face the challenge, and it's an enormous one, of changing from physical infrastructure based on paper distribution to a digital infrastructure based on data distribution. This means changing the banking business model from the top down, as the Internet now supports financial operations, and that is what Fintech is all about. Traditional banks have branches and employees that will have to be relocated to other services or roles.Is it a challenge?Absolutely. The challenge facing traditional banks is to make progress towards digital structures, and to do this they need to rethink the current model. A good indication that change is needed can be found just by booking at the majority of bank executives, in particular CEOs, who tackle financial tasks such as risk management and regulations based on accounting backgrounds; but they have no grasp of, or training in, technology. The exception to the rule is Francisco González, Chairman of BBVA, who began his career as an IT programmer and understands the important role that technology plays in operations. I think this is why we are seeing other Spanish banks, such as Santander and Sabadell, moving more rapidly toward digital structure, while in the UK, in contrast, we find no executive or leader with a tech background.Will technology bring savings for banks?Just imagine! If people connect directly via software or a server, the spread between a person who has money and someone who needs it is 50 bps, while if we factor in human resources, buildings, branches, risk management, all the paper forms, controls and verifications... then said cost is statistically 200 bps or more. In short, the new players are offering and making money at half the cost of traditional players. Should we fear the financial revolution?I hold that the business model followed by traditional banks must change. And that doesn't mean people losing their jobs, as branch staff can provide just as good customer service on Facebook. It's not about them being laid off. As was said this week on the BBC in a program about artificial intelligence, more jobs have been created over the last 50 years thanks to technology than have been destroyed.The concern is not the loss of jobs. We need to understand what new role people will have to play and the infrastructure that is required in a technological world. Traditional banks, and a good example is MetroBank in the United Kingdom, need to integrate their value systems. When there are hundreds of technological parts, banks need to develop both internal and external controls and bring the parts together in order to further drive progress.";otherFinance;http://thefinanser.co.uk/fsclub/2015/10/the-business-model-followed-by-traditional-banks-must-change.html
133;Can Big Data Recreate Personal Touch of Bygone Banking? RBS Thinks SoChristian Nelissen, the self-proclaimed “Data Guy” at Royal Bank of Scotland, wants to bring banking back to the 1970s.Not in the sense of bell-bottoms, alligator shirts and pet rocks, and certainly not COBOL programs and mainframes. What Nelissen aims to do is bring back the type of personal relationship customers used to have with their local bank branch manager, albeit through data analytics. (His official title at the bank is head of data and analytics.)“The bank manager was someone who really cared about you, he wasn’t just there to make more money from you,” said Nelissen, who is based in London. “I’m trying to hark back to that time when the bank manager made a difference in the community.”In trying to use Big Data to build stronger relationships with customers, RBS is taking a path also being followed by U.S. financial institutions, including USAA, Citi and Wells Fargo, all of which are building omnichannel analytics that, among other things, hand data from one channel (such as mobile) to another (such as the call center). The goal is to create a consistent experience for customers no matter how they interact with the bank.Can an analytics engine really bring warmth and trust back to customer relationships?“We have more information about our customers now than we’ve ever had,” Nelissen said. “Customers do more with us, we see more transaction activity and we know the detail of a lot of transaction activity. We see them spending money, we see them online. And we still have conversations with them and we can capture conversations.”The analytics engine RBS is building, it is hoped, will identify appropriate times for customer conversations. Not just to sell them products, but to help them, for instance, when they’re struggling with an online application.U.S. banks tend to comb through transaction, social and other data for “life events” – signs that someone is about to buy a house, get married, have a baby or do something else that might trigger new financial needs.RBS takes a different angle. The bank looks for very small things that are meaningful in customers’ lives, seeking to make a connection rather than push a product. It sends messages to customers on their birthday. It finds instances where they’ve paid for something twice, and lets them know. Employees call customers when they see the customer could be borrowing at a lower rate than the one they’re currently getting from the bank. They notify customers when they’ve walked away from an ATM without taking the money (this happens about 500,000 times a year to bank customers, believe it or not).“If the bank manager in the '70s saw you doing something they thought you could do better, they would tell you,” Nelissen noted. “We call the customer. We want to get out in front of customers.”Sometimes customers come back to the bank when they are ready to buy a new financial product, because of a pleasant conversation they had with a banker.;otherFinance;http://www.americanbanker.com/news/bank-technology/can-big-data-recreate-personal-touch-of-bygone-banking-rbs-thinks-so-1077375-1.html
134;"Continuous Innovation: How Financial Services Companies Can Get - and Stay - Ahead of Competition A digital arms race is underway in the financial services industry. Customers are demanding new digital products, services, and business models. With competition mounting from both established players and disruptive new market entrants, traditional financial institutions are under pressure to innovate, and do it fast.Consider the following real-world example: two large banks are vying to win, serve, and retain digitally savvy customers. Both decide to build a new mobile-enabled customer services application, the starter gun sounds, and the race is on. First to deliver, wins the market.  Bank #1 spent time in the design and development phase. Its application would be packed with every conceivable feature its customers might desire. It planned to launch its application with a “big bang.”Bank #2 focused on a simple initial release that allowed customers to do one thing: check their account balance. It beat Bank #1 to the market by months, and from there, it iterated in small chunks, adding functionality users actually valued, based on real user feedback.Can you guess which organisation went on to win multiple awards for application usability and customer satisfaction? Bank #2, of course.Banks are Betting Big on Digital TransformationIDC predicts that retail banks alone will spend nearly $16.6 billion implementing digital transformation initiatives in 2015. And this spending will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.4 per cent into 2019.In order to invest most effectively, though, financial services organisations must come to terms with two critical aspects of digital innovation. First, speed wins in the marketplace. There are countless examples of companies and products that achieved a dominant position by virtue of being first to market. Nowadays, taking months or years to deliver an application just won’t cut the mustard.Second, innovation is a process, not a project. Traditional projects have a beginning, and if they are lucky, a middle and an end. In contrast, digital applications are living and breathing entities. Like Bank #2’s mobile app, they continually evolve in response to user feedback, new business needs, and competitive threats.Traditional IT is a Hammer but Digital Innovation Isn’t a NailUnfortunately, speed and agility aren’t the hallmarks of traditional IT teams. That’s no knock on them, more a recognition of what they’re set up to do: maintain the organisation’s core systems of record in a reliable, predictable, and safe way.That doesn’t mean the same approach should be used to build applications designed to digitise customer engagement; deliver new products and services; and form the backbone of new business models. In contrast to systems of record, these systems of innovation represent new and experimental ideas that aren’t always well understood, yet must be delivered rapidly to gain competitive advantage.To meet these two very different needs within their application portfolios, IT organisations must implement a bimodal or two-speed IT approach. As Gartner writes in Forbes, “In Mode 1, IT operates traditional IT services, emphasising safety and accuracy — what a traditional IT organisation does best. Mode 2 emphasises agility and speed, like a digital startup.”Currently, 45 per cent of organisations have a second, fast mode of operation. By 2017, Gartner predicts that 75 per cent of IT organisations will have a bimodal capability.Your Innovation Fast Lane Requires 3P’sWhere many financial services organisations fail is by attempting to put Mode 1 resources on Mode 2 initiatives. To successfully deliver new systems of innovation, a Mode 2 fast lane requires a different mix of people, processes, and platform from existing IT:•People – a small, cross-functional team that’s focused exclusively on innovative digital applications. Typically, team members are tech-savvy business people or business-savvy tech people—the point being that they’re able to bridge the gap between business needs and technical possibilities to quickly transform ideas into applications.•Process – because requirements for digital solutions are often fuzzy, teams should work in short, iterative cycles in close collaboration with end users. The key is to break an application into small components, creating functionality, releasing it, and iterating continually based on user feedback. This process should continue for as long as the application lives. •Platform – modern cloud application platforms eliminate constraints associated with traditional development tools. The use of visual models to define an application’s data model, UI and logic creates a common language for business and IT to collaborate, while delivering big productivity gains over hand-coding. In addition, these platforms further shorten time to market through reusable components, one-click cloud deployment, and more.Delivering Disruptive Innovation without Disrupting Your OrganisationThe entire financial services industry is scrambling to figure out the formula for digital transformation. But many are doing digital a disservice by making it sound too big and too scary, as if it massive cultural change and multi-year, multi-million-dollar projects were the only way forward.A bimodal IT approach allows you to embark upon your digital journey without completely changing everything. Mode 2 fast lanes sit alongside, and augment, existing IT, allowing each to focus on what they do best. In the process, you’re able to start small and get some quick wins under your belt, giving you the confidence and proof required to scale your innovation programme.Interestingly, you deliver disruptive innovation without disrupting your organisation. You build a culture of innovation that spreads organically throughout the company, without forcing the massive organisational change that stops most initiatives dead in their tracks. In large, traditional, and risk-averse organisations, this is crucial to success.With the pace of innovation accelerating, demand for new applications will only grow. The rallying call of this digital arms race is ‘Innovate or Die.’ To survive and thrive, financial services organisations must create a culture of continuous innovation where systems of innovation are built rapidly, deployed instantly, and changed easily.

135;Do We Need Better System Integration or Fewer Systems to Integrate? September 3, 2014 by GonzoBanker 0902a“We are stuck with technology when what we really want is just stuff that works.”_Douglas Adams, the Salmon of DoubtIf I were to go to most bankers today and ask them what one thing they would do to improve their systems environment, a large number would say better integration of the systems they are using.Ten years ago, if I had asked them that same question, the majority probably would have said – hang on to your hats here – better systems integration. Despite a lot of focus on middleware, application programming interfaces (APIs) and other tools, this issue has never stopped being top off mind with system users.So this brings me to another, related question. How many readers have waited to board a delayed flight that was supposed to take off in 20 minutes but there was no stinkin’ plane at the gate and the gate agents were completely silent and pretending nothing’s wrong? Maddening, wasn’t it?It’s funny how that doesn’t happen to me anymore. The late part does, but not the lack of information. This week, I received an alert from the airline telling me my flight would be delayed, and I got it before the gate agents were notified. In this case, the gate agent asked me if I’d heard anything yet.Why? Because she and I both had access to the exact same system, but it so happened that I got notified first. So did about 20 other people. My frustration with the flight being late was there, but I had no problems with the experience. In fact, it’s better.So let’s ask ourselves this: in banking, why does crossing channels still equate to crossing systems that then need to be integrated? In other industries that rely on digital and physical channels, there is a very clear design principle: there is one system for both customer self-service and employee delivery to customers. There are just different levels of permissions and configuration. Think about it. Did Amazon design one system for employees and another for customers? Uber? Fed Ex for tracking shipments? Of course not. They never even thought about it. And, to boot, they started their system design from the front end (consumer experience) and designed the back end second.140902bJump to our current set of banking delivery systems. I just finished sitting through the third omnichannel presentation in two weeks telling me that customers want a seamless experience when crossing channels. Really? Like I thought they wanted it to be choppy? (For a more thorough discussion of the current state of omnichannel delivery, check out Scott Hodgins’ recent post, Meet Brock Thorpe. Pretty much summed it up.)Now, to be fair to the banking industry, we had to have systems designed for employees long before customer self-service was an issue. Branches, lending, call center – they were built after the back-end system was written, and they were built on the older platforms that were available at the time. Then, years later, we had to design self-service solutions that we couldn’t use the older tools to build. The result was different systems for customers and employees. OK, there was really no other way it could have played out. But where does that leave us now? Well …_In most financial institutions, if a customer starts a deposit application on line and wants to finish it in the branch, data has to pass to the branch platform system._If a loan application gets started on line, data is usually passed between the application system and the underwriting/closing/doc system._If a customer corresponds with the FI via the online app system (a question, a problem), it never gets passed to the core or CRM contact history file._The customer digital self-service channel tool for commercial banking is this cool 20th-century system called “send-an-e-mail.”These are just a few examples of multi-system design results that need to be improved to provide the experience customers get in other industries. The question we have to discuss, banks and vendors, is this: over time, how much of this do we want to accomplish by building better integration between systems, and how much do we want to do by rewriting systems following the design principle of other industries – customers and employees use a common system and the front-end experience is the start point?Increasingly, the evidence points to the latter option and we can see it already taking hold:Mortgage. You can see the progress and the benefits. A ton of mortgage lenders now have employees input the app in the same system the customer uses. Loan status notifications get sent to the employees assigned to the loan and the customer at the same time. One database. No interface. Man, you have to give it to Mortgagebot and Prime Alliance. Maybe a lot of it wasn’t planned at first, and their original idea was only to get an online 1003, but look where mortgage application systems are now. Those guys started a big ball rolling._ Prediction: This is over. There is one mortgage application tool for customers and employees. More and more of the back-end functions will be rolled into the application tool over time and we’ll be down to one system.Deposit Account Opening. In at least half of the system selections we have done in the last two years that involved branches, the system selected for online applications was also deployed in the branch new accounts area. Customers and employees see the same information and update the same file, just with different permissions. Same system, same application that a customer and an employee works on sans integration. And, for grins, let’s throw in Consumer Loan Applications, which are being designed on the same platform. Meridian Link http://www.meridianlink.com/ got the early lead in this area, but there are several very credible solutions offered by core and independent vendors that have the same design and intent. Now, I understand that the pushback right now on these systems is that they don’t yet do all of the maintenance transactions, and they can be expensive. My response? First, where do we put our dollars: integrating two systems, or building out maintenance and other capabilities in the front-end application system? I vote the latter. And, as for cost, it will not slow this trend. Cost always gets rational and commoditized._ Prediction: There will be one system used by customers and employees for deposit origination and consumer loan applications in the next two to four years at most banks. The online application system will replace the current branch deposit opening system. Maintenance and other transactions will be added to the origination system. Adios to the traditional new accounts software. Let’s get on with it.140902cTransaction Processing and Servicing. I am going to include teller systems, call center systems, Internet banking and mobile in this discussion. And, just to sweeten the pot, let’s add small business to the retail customer base. Here’s my take: can’t we already see the merging of service transactions? Let’s look at behavior. Customers deposit checks on their own, and we do it for them. They look up history, we look up history. They look up images, we look up images. They look at transaction history, we do too. They renew CDs, we do too. They use portable devices much more, and we are talking about branches where employees are walking around with mobile devices. Both customers and tellers end up out of balance at the end of the day, trying to find the $20 they’re short (well, speaking for myself, anyway). Question: this being the case, why should customers and employees use different systems to do all of this? What makes the question even more interesting is that among the other things mobile devices and software bring to the table is the long-term ability to pull this off on one system. Several vendors, Malauzai being one example, are already showing this thinking in their designs.Now I can hear the pushback. What about all of the teller transactions that have nothing to do with customers? Buy/sell cash. Place a 2-sig required hold. Why would we want to do that?My answer? Where do we want to spend our money – maintaining different systems for employees (many on older platforms) and customers, then maintaining a raft of integration (CRM, imaging systems, etc.), or writing one system everybody can use and integrating these systems once, with the added bonus of designing an experience and service level that makes customers feel like they are dealing with a digital-age company? I think this dude’s vote is clear._ Prediction: We will start this conversation in earnest with the long-term goal of having one servicing system for customers and all employees, and the system/design that will survive is …. mobile. Yes, Gonzo devotees, tellers will ultimately use an amped-up mobile app. Call me a nitwit if you like, but at least give me that I left the box. So, let’s get on with it.Commercial. A tougher conversation, because there is a lot less self-service that occurs in these relationships. But, we can all see the early design in commercial lending systems that incorporate the customer into the employee workflow tool. We need new financial statements or tax returns. We track them in system workflow. The customer accesses the same system to provide them and clear the item._ Prediction: There will be a single system used by employees and customers for any decisioning or servicing interactions that require both parties to do something. Good news – we’re already getting on with it.I don’t underestimate the cost, effort and frustration all this would entail. I get the years of design that would be given the axe. I even get that by now some readers have decided that my IQ is slightly below that of a tree stump.But you know what? I keep hearing that the industry needs to be relevant in customers’ daily activities. And hip. And that, more and more, it’s about the customer experience being consistent across channels. And that their yardstick for rating our experience is Apple, and Amazon, and lots of other non-bank players.They only have one system for everybody, not different ones they integrate.So, let’s get on with it.;otherFinance;http://bankinnovation.net/2014/09/do-we-need-better-system-integration-or-fewer-systems-to-integrate/
136;"Digitalisation Is The New Treasury World, But Has It Really Helped Treasurers?Treasury Management SystemsDigitalisation is the buzzword we hear everywhere but what has actually happened to significantly reduce the burden on treasurers? Not enough, both technology providers but also advisory capabilities from the banks and different players in the treasury ecosystem have not helped to support enough the view treasurers’ need through a holistic lens.Many technology providers and advisors remain focused on traditional product verticals with no real focus on how the products impact the complete cash management life cycle and liquidity position and how to help with better information about cash to understand the nature of exposure and build further an improved profile per currency.Treasuries are enjoying an increased strategic role in their firms and are looking to take advantage of opportunities in innovation where technology can carry out once-laborious manual processes more quickly. But they also have expectations to do this focusing on complete liquidity position, without traditional product verticals offered by banks and software houses; something that will require digital platforms but also new type of salesmen and advisors to be able to address a rising demand for a new type of treasury consultation. Additionally, many regulations have indirect effects on bank clients and somebody knowing the technology but also regulatory effects should help the clients.As treasurers increasingly must do more with less, the spreadsheet approach that many surprisingly still use to manage treasury operations across the entire company reaches its limits. At the same time, need for real-time information, the silos we have with the systems further complicate the need for efficiency, visibility and control.Enterprise resource planning systems (ERP) usually cover much of the financial supply chain and it is the base system for companies where all relevant data is stored and connected with each other. Despite the evolution of many ERP systems in the treasury space, the functional coverage may not be sufficient for some organisations and that is probably one reason for the strong uptake of treasury management systems (TMS), especially the cloud-based setups. TMS systems provides highly specialised technology for treasurers allowing for more flexibility in terms of features and access.The TMS is farthest away from the ERP system, and it requires an interface to connect with key data from the ERP system for treasury operations. There are solutions that are integrated in an ERP can offer the best of both worlds but not all.Technology is increasingly providing greater access to more real-time information, transaction channels are emerging also and focus has shifted to mobile devices. Some innovative software companies have succeed in the treasury technology market and continue to emerge after others are acquired because corporate treasury teams demand a distinct set of complex features. There is no such thing as ‘nice to have’ features. There are features that add value and those that do not. The list of those that add value is lengthy, ranging from simple bank connectivity to cash forecasting, bank analysis and market information. More recently, both working capital and risk management have emerged as ‘must haves’ within every treasury system. Many of the technologies currently used have been around for some time, but until recently the business case and demand for their use by treasury had not been made. Drivers behind the business case are standardisation itself; BPO in trade finance, commodities standardisation, seamless FX reporting, electronic bank account management and digital personal signatures just to give some examples. New era started also when SWIFT opened its door to corporates.To really utilise the benefits of technological progress and standards in the treasury area in the future there should be much more communication between corporates and external parties like software providers and consultants but especially banks.Treasury advisors should help clients to implement simplified setup to increase transaction efficiency significantly and not to focus traditional product verticals like only to A/P and A/R or e-invoices, fx- confirmations or market data. Today's technology can bring access and great visibility across all client's bank accounts through a single treasury hub.Another key benefit with a single hub is greater security and control and the beauty to havea complete picture from beginning to end. Combining different systems the treasury previously used into one can also reduce costs significantly.The most important value for the treasury is that they can add greater strategic value to the whole company and focus on financial risk management strategies or even more efficient working capital and streamlining of trade finance operations and truly leverage the information for business units. With the co-operation by software providers, consultants and banks within treasury ecosystem we need to be able to conduct a new type of holistic operational review in order to identify the company’s operational challenges and impact of regulations, compliance and risk on their business.  We should be able to recommend process changes and technology solutions that will ensure automation and efficiency from invoicing to collection and liquidity position handling and to help treasurers meet their liquidity and risk-management needs.With the digital platforms and cooperation among different stakeholders within treasury ecosystem, we should be able together automate routine tasks and significantly improve the speed and efficiency of day-to-day treasury operations, and reduce the burden on treasury departments considerably.Customer experience should be the key for all stakeholders.The challenge, however, has been always that all service providers are competing for the same customers. Emerging technology is making it easier for new entrants to exploit areas of dissatisfaction and underinvestment. Customers have more options than ever and do not view banks and software providers as having significant advantage over newer types of banks and startups and technology companies – even when it comes to advice. This requires a shift from a transactional and silo driven mindset to one that is more focused on the joint relationship with the customer with the value adding co-operation.We have seen more corporates focus on centralised risk, cash and liquidity management by setting up global pooling structures, in-house banks and payment and collection factories across the entire company and gradually utilising the current wave of massive standardisation not only with the traditional payment transactions but also gradually focusing on entire treasury value chain. These have a knock-on effect in treasury systems but also to the dialogue among stakeholders within the treasury ecosystem as they require relevant changes in functionality but also totally new way of communication and cooperation among stakeholders without product verticals and together with the customer.Corporate treasurers are no longer simply focused on basic liquidity, cash, funding, investing and risk and compliance duties. Treasurers are looking for centralised solutions that essentially meet all of their requirements and can accommodate the workflows and business practices. They are also asking software providers to be more than just that. Software providers should be able to behave as strategic and trusted partners, advisors with several years of experience who can take a consultative approach to the relationship and who can cooperate with the banks and other providers in the treasury ecosystem. There is still much work to do and we are curious to see who will take the treasury hub position and who will be a strategic partner, and can both innovate and quickly adapt to challenges that are on the horizon. Change is constant and life will be full of consolidations, economic changes, mergers and acquisitions, new digital innovation and changing regulatory scene and corporate treasurers need one point of entry who can act as an advisor.By Kirsi Larkiala and Johannes Asuja, bobsguide contributors";otherFinance;http://www.bobsguide.com/guide/news/2015/Aug/28/digitalisation-is-the-new-treasury-world-but-has-it-really-helped-treasurers.html

138;"SWIFT Aims to Transform the Business of Corporate Banking SWIFT has a bold ambition. As part of the SWIFT2020 strategy, it is aiming to become the preferred secure network for multi-banked corporates globally.Since 2008, the number of corporate groups using SWIFT has more than tripled to over 1,400. The cooperative organisation now has a market share of around 45% of the Fortune Global 500.""Typically, we are seen as a solution for large corporates only, which is a misconception,"" says Alain Raes, Chief Executive, EMEA and Asia Pacific, SWIFT. ""We also offer small and medium enterprises tailor-made solutions and products. Around half of the corporates who have joined us since 2014 have a turnover of less than US$1 billion, and 37% have a turnover of less than $0.5 billion.""Raes shares that to meet growing demands of corporates, SWIFT will be enriching its current offerings to extend messaging solutions in payments, treasury, trade finance, securities and regulatory reporting.""We also plan to grow relevant value-added services in the corporates segment by introducing BPO/TSU, 3SKey, SWIFTRef, MyStandards and Financial Crime Compliance Services,"" adds Raes.Growing APAC marketTo expand its global footprint, SWIFT is putting more emphasis on the growing APAC market. APAC represents a huge market of long standing, and often very well known, international corporates on one hand, and fast developing domestic or regional entities on the other.""Both categories need to further streamline and automate their banking operations. We have already seen more than 16% year on year growth in new corporates joining SWIFT in APAC, but considering the size and potential of the region, I don't see any reason why this growth should not accelerate further.""Raes says SWIFT's implementation plan will be complemented by an industrialization effort across segments by improving bank readiness, increasing bank awareness within the banking community and further optimising SWIFT's on-boarding processes, with a dedicated corporate sales team in China, Hong Kong, Korea, Japan, Singapore, Australia and India.Alliance Lite2""We will also be promoting the use of SWIFT certified application providers integrating Alliance Lite2 to offer easier access for corporates to connect to SWIFT. There are currently ten providers connecting 70+ new corporates.""Alliance Lite2 is a prime example of how SWIFT is evolving its proposition in line with the shifting and growing role of the corporate treasurer.Alliance Lite2 is a web-based solution designed for corporates with capabilities for straight-through processing and automation of financial process flows. It requires minimal infrastructure to maintain, low up-front costs, low monthly fees, and shorter implementation timelines.""Going forward, we intend to enhance the features with an entry-level 'plug and play' functionality for treasurers to manage their multi-bank treasury and cash management operations, such as account balance dashboards, reporting and payment initiations,"" adds Raes.While multiple banking relationships are generally a necessity in an age of increased cross-border activity, there is a rising popularity of RTCs and in-house banks in Asia.""In the midst of this growing trend,""ù says Raes, ""corporates often find themselves needing to move liquidity rapidly between accounts. By using SWIFT, corporates can improve operational efficiency by implementing better workflow control, consolidating the financial transactions of their group companies and managing multiple banking partners.""Supporting the digital marchTrade digitization is perhaps the most challenging issue for the corporate community today, given the number of players involved in trade processes.According to Andre Casterman, who heads up development in the corporate and trade markets, SWIFT offers an ideal platform through which to build capabilities in transaction services in treasury and trade.""Trade finance services are being increasingly digitised through corporate-to-corporate hubs, new entrants (such as alternative finance providers) and SWIFT/International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) standards,""ù he says.""It's key for exporters to be able to provide a better service for their clients (importers) by avoiding the inefficiencies related to paper-based practices. Businesses want to move away from Letters of Credit.""Information gets the world economy moving, but if the information is only on paper, you cannot perform big data analysis, you cannott profile the data and find patterns which help to identify trade-based money laundering. Banks must move digital in this space too in order to become more agile, attract more trade flows and increase their compliance with trade-specific regulatory requirements.""To this end, we are partnering with a number of third party platforms, such as essDOCS, to help better digitize trade information flows in the corporate-to-corporate space. This is very transformative - there is a huge business opportunity for banks to finance more trade flows, and technology is the primary enabler.""Shining a guiding lightSWIFT's ambitious plans in the corporate space are supported by the Corporate Advisory Group, which plays a central role in terms of strategy and governance.The group, comprised of e-commerce leaders from major transaction banks and the main global banks, including Citi, JP Morgan and HSBC, meets twice yearly and influences the direction of SWIFT's thinking.Chair of the Corporate Advisory Group and SWIFT Board member Marcus Treacher explains: ""Every member of the group runs corporate-facing banking units - so they know exactly what the corporate world wants, and needs.""";otherFinance;http://www.cfoinnovation.com/story/10308/swift-aims-transform-business-corporate-banking
139;High Cost Driving Finance Professionals Away From Paper Checks New research by the Association for Financial Professionals reveals that the high cost of check transactions is driving treasury and finance professionals away from paper checks.AFP conducted its inaugural 2015 Payments Cost Benchmarking Survey to provide more granular information on the costs of making payments through checks, ACH, wires and cards, as well as to gauge payment trends by organization size.The report provides transaction volumes and detailed cost data for key payment methods. Results distinguish between external and internal costs and highlight median ranges for various demographic categories and payment methods.According to the survey, nearly 80 percent of organizations are in the process of transitioning their business-to-business payments from paper checks to electronic payments.The report also reveals that more than two out of three organizations would replace paper checks with electronic payments if there was a cost benefit of doing so, while 88 percent cite increased efficiency as the primary reason for transitioning to electronic payments from paper checks.“The report findings reinforce what we hear every day from our clients—that check-based payments are costly and inefficient and automation is a critical to support business growth,” said Jessica Moran, General Manager of Cloud Payment Solutions at Bottomline Technologies. “Leveraging this credible benchmark data is extremely useful for finance professionals making the case for automation.”“Treasury and finance departments are increasingly tasked with innovating and adapting to better serve their organizations, and moving from paper to electronic is one way to do so,” says Jim Kaitz, AFP President and Chief Executive Officer. “AFP looks forward to tracking how payment trends and the associated costs will evolve over time.”;otherFinance;http://www.cfoinnovation.com/story/10395/high-cost-driving-finance-professionals-away-paper-checks
140;We need banking, and yes we also need banks Chris Skinner defends his position when it comes to the future of banking, where he sees banks as still playing a role. We need banking, and yes we also need banks on BankNXT.I realized recently that my course of opinion is rather different to several other commentators, so felt it worth noting where we agree and disagree. Where I agree with most fintech people is that:•Digital replaces physical•Fintech is changing banking forever•Mobile is getting rid of cash•You can have money without borders.Where I disagree with most fintech people is that:•Branches are necessary•Fintech isn't disrupting banks•We need banking and we need banks•You cannot have money without government.In other words, some fintech people believe branches are irrelevant, that banks will disappear, and a libertarian dream of the free markets controlling the world are all feasible. I don't. Now, I've covered these in depth before:The list goes on, so why am I writing this again? I guess because it's becoming blatantly obvious that most banks have woken up to the technology debate. Digital is on the boardroom agenda, and when Jamie Dimon says Silicon Valley is coming, we all know it's taken seriously. However, you talk to some banks, and you think they have no idea. They've not heard of blockchain, think of mobile as being their iPhone app, and reckon that fintech is what you attach to a fish.Those banks are likely to disappear due to their complacency and ignorance, but those banks are in the minority. This is then where the discussion gets interesting. As mentioned on Friday, banks have time to adapt. Most banks have millions of customers, and customers suffer from great inertia. After all, all banks are the same aren't they?So, banks have the advantage of being there already, with a customer who's unlikely to change banks. In addition, they have a license, and most banks know that anything to do with money needs a government license. Just as James Bond needs a license to kill (or he'll get jailed, as it would be murder), banks need a license to bank, otherwise it's illegal as it would easily allow money laundering and robbery.This is why we can have the idealistic hope that society can run without a legal system, but the reality is it has one and needs one. Otherwise, every day would be like The Purge.[embedded content]So, banks have the upper hand. New fintech firms have been attacking the business model of banks, but the startup has to build customers, trust and critical mass, and this takes time. Equally, when they do get critical mass, the law steps in. Just look at the challenges Uber is having as licensing and law catches up. The same is felt to be true for the likes of payments and crowdfunding firms, and certainly we've seen that with the likes of peer-to-peer lenders and bitcoin. Just look at the American laws on the sourcing of funds for P2P or the BitLicence and you'll see what I mean.This doesn't mean that banks can sit back and ignore the challenge, and they do have to change, and this is where the real zinger hits. After all, it's the old but still salient point made by Charles Darwin:1And banks are adaptable to change. This is why, when it was forecast they would all go belly up 20 years ago, they're still here and bigger than ever. Banks will still be here in 20 years. They will be different. They will be far more technology integrated and enabled, but they will still be banks, with licenses and customers, and trust to keep value and not lose it.;otherFinance;http://banknxt.com/53469/we-need-banks/
141;"Deutsche Bank reviews future of Italian business The Deutsche Bank headquarters are seen in Frankfurt, Germany October 8, 2015. Reuters/Ralph Orlowski Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) is considering scaling back its Italian retail operations by selling branches and cutting jobs as its new chief executive overhauls the company to keep pace with rivals, according to five sources familiar with the matter. CEO John Cryan is under pressure to reform Germany's flagship bank to reduce costs and boost profitability, after costly litigation from a series of scandals and the fallout from the Asian market rout pushed its valuation well below competitors such as Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX) and UBS (UBSG.VX).Italy is Deutsche Bank's second-biggest European retail business after Germany, with 4,000 staff and around 300 branches. The review could lead to a large reduction of its operations and pave the way for a possible exit from the country further down the line, three of the sources said.""No final decision has been taken on what to sell - and how to sell it - in Italy. But Deutsche Bank's presence in the country is no longer seen as strategic,"" said one source.Deutsche Bank declined to comment. The bank announced a record pretax loss of 6 billion euros ($6.8 billion) in the third quarter and warned of a possible dividend cut. Cryan, who became CEO in July with a promise to reduce costs, is due to reveal details of its new strategy on Thursday. Last year Deutsche Bank took steps to shrink its Italian network and sold 90 branches as part of a sale-and-leaseback deal with a property investor. But a further reduction of its operations would represent a significant step in a country where it has been present since the 1920s and which it has said is profitable ""despite a difficult market environment"".It would not be alone in retreating, however. Other international banks including Barclays (BARC.L) and GE Capital have put their Italian units on the block as they shift their focus away from certain European markets.If it seeks to sell branches, one of the sources said Deutsche could tap the likes of ING (ING.AS) and Mediobanca's (MDBI.MI) retail arm Che Banca, which Reuters has reported have expressed an interest in Barclays' network. But the source cautioned that appetite to invest in branches has waned due to the rise of online banking. ""There are not many buyers out there for bank branches but those working on Barclays' Italian network are likely to take a look,"" said the source, who is familiar with Barclays' process.'CROWN JEWEL'The overhaul at Deutsche Bank is part of a wide-ranging restructuring at European investment banks. Thousands of jobs cuts, business closures and billions of euros of capital raisings are on the cards as bosses respond to pressure to devise new strategies to revive them. Deutsche Bank also has a financial advice and investment business in Italy, Finanza & Futuro. It manages 10 billion euros on behalf of around 126,000 clients, according to its website.There are no immediate plans to sell the lucrative unit but it could be an option if Cryan wants to build up cash, according to three of the sources.""Finanza & Futuro is Deutsche's crown jewel in Italy,"" said one of the sources, an investment banker who has looked at it in the past on behalf of private equity bidders. ""Private equity funds have been circling for a while and remain interested,"" he said, adding that no sales process was underway. ""It will largely depend on whether Cryan wants to avoid another rights issue,"" another source said. ""If a capital buffer is what he needs, then he will probably include Finanza & Futuro in the exit pipeline."" In 2014, Deutsche Bank raised 8.5 billion euros in new capital with the Qatari royal family as a major new investor. The bank had previously raised 10.2 billion euros in 2010 and 3 billion euros in 2013.Details of the Deutsche Bank restructuring already announced this month include splitting its investment bank in two and parting ways with some of its top bankers. It will also split up its wealth management division into one business looking after its super rich clients and another focusing on institutional clients and funds.";otherFinance;http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/26/us-deutsche-bank-italy-exclusive-idUSKCN0SK2LM20151026?feedType=RSS&feedName=businessNews
142;Money transfer – an interview with Money Mover CEO Hamish AndersonAndy Homer interviews Money Mover CEO Hamish Anderson, who talks about the money transfer marketplace.Hamish Anderson, what inspired you to form Money Mover?Money Mover is an online business currency exchange service that Andrew Comber and I set up in 2014. I worked for several large banks before Money Mover, including HSBC, Merrill Lynch, Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein and Schroders.Hamish Anderson, Money Mover CEOWe knew that SMEs had traditionally been underserved and overcharged by banks for almost any service. Consumers benefit from special offers and competitive rates, and big corporations can use their size to leverage the best deal. SMEs are caught in the middle.This is as true for global payments and foreign exchange (FX) as it is for any other service. Speaking to friends and colleagues, it became clear that even financially and technologically literate people accepted the status quo. They just went to their banks when they needed to move money abroad. Fees, charges and wide currency spreads were accepted as a fact of life, and they were never really sure when their money would arrive at its destination. In particular, small and medium-sized businesses doing significant international trade were not benefiting from the ‘wholesale’ rates that they should be entitled to, given volumes.We knew that there was an opportunity to offer SMEs something they couldn’t get anywhere else – a service that’s transparent and offers low-cost, predefined rates. While we do very often reduce total fees by up to 90%, what really inspires and motivates us is using technology to improve transparency and the user experience. We know how SMEs work, and the Money Mover platform reflects this.What do you believe makes you stand out in an already crowded market?Our focus on SMEs is unique. Our typical customer makes or receives regular international payments, or perhaps they have supplier relationships outside the UK. There are others in the market who look similar but use peer-to-peer systems aimed at consumers that are not aligned with the needs of SMEs. We’re unique because you know exactly what exchange rate is being used, how much is being charged, and there’s no peer-to-peer matching getting in the way.We offer the mid-market exchange rate and then apply a single, all-inclusive fee. While this means money transfers are cheaper, it’s this transparency that really makes Money Mover stand out.In your opinion, why should an SME use Money Mover?When we stepped back and looked at the international business payments, we realized that no one had yet designed a service that provided tools and functionality specifically for SMEs. Most of the other services out there are really run for the benefit of the providers. We’ve approached the problem from the SME’s perspective and have tried to address the problems they face. For example, we’ve made it easy to get real-time market quotes, create and download reports, and track where a payment is at any stage of its life cycle. We’ve also created a fully audited user and account structure that allows professional advisers, such as accountants or outsourced finance directors, to work with multiple businesses from a single profile. We’re updating our web application constantly to respond to feedback and requests from our customers. It really is a platform built for its users by its users.While most of our customers use Money Mover to make payments to third parties, an increasing number use us, rather than their banks, to move funds between their local currency bank accounts. This is because Money Mover is less expensive, faster and we disclose our fees up front. It’s alarming that banks’ regard for SMEs is so meagre that even these internal transfers are a ripoff. To be blunt, any SME in need of global payments and FX system, however infrequently, should be using Money Mover.So far, money transfer has been focused on consumers over small businesses. How big is this market?The SME market is huge and dwarves the consumer market by quite some margin. SMEs make US $5.6tn in international payments each year. Consumer money transfer grabs the headlines simply because consumer services tend to do so – there’s a chance that anyone could use a consumer service, whereas Money Mover is used mainly by entrepreneurs, business owners and directors. This tends to skew the perception of the SME market in general, and is possibly why they’re so underserved by banks.The service you offer is a threat to banks. How do you think established financial institutions will react in the long-term?Increasingly, retail and business bank customers are not wedded to the traditional players and are open to alternatives offered by the best fintech companies. Yet, the big financial behemoths still have size and inertia on their side. We talk of fintech disruption, but in relation to the sheer scale of the big banks, it’s still just a ripple.In the short-term, we don’t expect any reaction. As a former banker myself, I can promise you that banks only perceive competition to come from the other glass towers in Canary Wharf, rather than Old Street or Silicon Fen. In the long-term, banks will need to react to specialist fintech players that are targeting specific parts of their business by attempting to become more agile, more transparent, and fairer to their SME customers. But we see this as a long way off and may well be too late to repair their reputations.Fintech is taking off around the world. What would you say are the challenges and opportunities for new players?It’s tough for new challengers to compete on a level playing field, as the banks are still the controllers of the financial infrastructure. For example, access to the core payments architecture, along which move the majority of global financial transactions, is jealously guarded by the largest banks and financial corporations. This won’t change until this architecture is ‘unbundled’ in the same way that telecom networks were, opening up competition.To give them their due, the UK FCA (Financial Conduct Authority) is one of the most enlightened regulators, and through Project Innovate and the new Payment Systems Regulator, is trying to set out the framework for this process.The opportunities for new players lie where the traditional players are refusing to change. If you’ve ever been frustrated or overcharged by a financial services provider – and it’s not down to regulation – then it’s likely to be ripe for disruption.Aside from money transfer, what area of fintech has the greatest potential?Money Mover is part of a bigger change in the way banking is done, and this change is where fintech has the biggest potential. Fintech is currently focused on cherry picking single aspects of financial services (eg invoice finance or international payments) and doing this one thing really well. But this means customers, in order to get the best service, need to go to a number of separate providers in order to access the suite of services they had previously received from a single provider – ie a bank.In the next few years, I predict that it will be possible to access the same suite of services, from best-of-breed providers, in a much more convenient way. The best providers will group together or combine to form virtual banks, without the legacy issues that hold back our existing banking sector. This reformation of the banking sector is where the potential really lies.;otherFinance;http://banknxt.com/54018/hamish-anderson/

144;"What’s the story?Most people today have at least heard the term “Internet of Things (IoT)” and have a hazy understanding of what it means. Internet of Things (IoT) includes anything and everything that is connected to the internet and able to communicate and share information with other “smart” devices. Sometimes this concept is referred to as “M2M”—“machine-to-machine” communication.   The Internet of Things (IoT) is defined as a way for sensors and machines to communicate with each other by combining the capabilities of big data, analytics and artificial intelligence to anticipate needs, solve problems, and increase efficiency.Big Data (capturing & storing the information) and Analytics (understanding the information) are hot trends now and there is lot of work happening in these areas. The Internet of Things goes a step beyond by making information readily available and consumable by other systems and networks. The IoT acts as an intermediary tool that helps turn information into a force that can boost efficiency, increase productivity and drive fundamental improvements in customer experiences.Just as various weather channels on television employ predictive graphics of what the weather patterns will be in the coming days and weeks, analysis of data from the internet of things will give us more concise predictions of what we will like, what we will need, and what we will do. It’s still early in the game. But this kind of awareness is starting to enter the consideration and we need to start envisaging the impact of this possible significant force on our industry.While many industries may have already grasped and embraced its benefits, the financial services industry is just beginning to see how IoT can propel the industry to the next level. There is a decent probability that this concept can have as much of a radical transformative effect as the onset of the internet itself has had over the past 25 years. Just as the internet has vastly connected people globally, the internet of things will vastly connect all the systems, devices, and infrastructures people use and depend on.The obvious question for us in the financial services industry is how we utilize this and how can this impact how we transact and communicate with customers. For banks the internet of things will deliver an unprecedented level of data and data-driven customer insight. This will allow banks to provide their customers a truly personalized experience with targeted advice, offers and insight.Some indicative scenarios are provided for easy understanding. The aim is to throw ideas of what is possible. While many of these scenarios may look far-fetched and ambitious at present, these are surely possible and considering the amazing rate of change in today’s world, many of these are and will be possible in the near future.Banking on The Internet of Things – Few potential scenarios  Using IoT to improve risk management, reduce cost and improve operational efficiency  Scenario – 1 – Collateral & loan arrangement verification  Corporate borrowers from manufacturing industry usually have a line of credit with banks for purchasing raw materials and to manage the production & regular expenses incurred. This is usually given as a running credit line /overdraft / working capital loan and banks take raw materials, WIP & finished goods as collateral.Presently the bank must monitor the inventory levels, cost of materials, sales and more to ensure that the loan agreement is being followed and that the borrower is not indulging in fraudulent practices. This process takes up many man-hours between the highly paid loan officer, the credit officer and loan administration staff to manually verify and document the stocks and is still not fool proof as there is lot of manual involvement.Using IoT, the bank can install sensors in its borrower's premises in the assembly line that track the raw, in-process, and finished inventory. Those sensors update the raw materials, produced stock numbers and can sync with the account balance and availability, and it can verify that the loan is paid down appropriately when sales are made. The business owner can upload any invoices or other required documentation with a picture snapped in the bank's smart-phone app.In this way, an expensive, burdensome process ripe with opportunities for mismanagement & fraud is now an automated, auditable and reliable business process on auto-pilot.Scenario – 2 – Auto Loans, Insurance Claim management.Many banks issue auto loans and many also have tie up’s with insurance companies or have insurance subsidiaries. In many countries vehicle thefts are prevalent and currently it’s mostly a manual tracking activity in conjunction with law enforcement agencies.Auto loan & insurance companies can incentivize the installation of location & impact sensors in the vehicle which cannot be tampered with. This will inform the respective companies as soon as someone tries to remove these from the vehicle or whenever the vehicle has had an impact above a certain level. This can go a long way in minimizing insurance frauds and vehicle theft recovery and is a win-win proposition for both the law abiding consumer as well as the financial companies. Using IoT to improve customer experience, create customer delight & also generate customer cross sell opportunities Scenario – 1 – Housing Loan / MortgagesMany people take housing loans / mortgages globally. Using IoT, the bank can explore giving an option to the new home buyers to install a sensor in their new homes, which will inform them (and the bank) when there is a dampness in the wall above a certain % or there is significant internal damage to the walls / roof due to say an earthquake? Presently, we come to know about these issues only when it’s visible in the inside portion of the wall / roof, by which time the damage to the walls has been done and this requires more exhaustive repairs, but by putting in a sensor in the walls, large scale damage can be prevented.How about an additional option, wherein the client is given an option to agree with the bank initially itself  that they will automatically issue a home improvement loan to cover the roof / wall repair costs and issue a work order to affiliated repairmen when the sensors indicate the roof / wall is leaking / damp above specific %?The benefit for the client would be preferred & discounted rates for these repairs (with enhanced warranty) + no additional paperwork for home improvement + insurance for any force majeure or unforeseen incidents + of-course pre-emptive & preventive repairs. The client can opt out of this arrangement later too.Scenario - 2 – Mobile Check-in to branchMobile banking usage is on the rise globally. Using location aware technologies will allow clients to automatically ""check in"" to the branch before they arrive. That will trigger a process to prepare the branch staff with your specific account information, your history, and your most likely needs that day. When you walk in the door, you're already first in line (depending on your customer profiling) and the banker will be fully up to speed on your unique financial situation. It's a proactive, fast, and customized process for every customer.This uses most of the things already available (mobile banking + smart-phones), only thing needed is realigning the business process as well as adding additional new functionality to mobile banking application.Scenario – 3 – Day out shoppingMost of us (if not all) do go out shopping. Say we went out shopping to an xxx mall. Bank comes to know through the location aware technology that we are in xxx mall. An alert is sent to our smart phone stating that the client has been pre-approved for a loan for yyyy amount at a preferred interest rate. All I need to do is click ok and his account will be credited. Also, there will be interest free credit for 60 days for any purchases in the next 6 hours in his credit card from a shop in that mall.I buy a LED TV for USD 2000 using my credit card. I get an alert asking whether I wants to save the receipt in my digital locker. I click a picture and save it to my locker. The bank comes to know from my credit card transaction and receipt that a LED Tv has been bought and sends me an offer for a monthly insurance for the TV at a highly discounted rate (based on my profile).Through the location app, they see that I am near a partner restaurant during the lunch hours. I get an offer to have lunch there and pay only 75% of the bill if I use the bank’s credit card. Bank can also show all partner food joint offers for that location.Scenario – 4 – Linking personal health to investment portfolioMany folks use personal health monitors nowadays. Say, that is connected to your main investment account held with a bank. If there is a severe health condition, the bank (and the investment manager) gets an alert and automatically the personal investment fund of the concerned person is rebalanced to protect any downside. (Say moving from equity to debt etc.). During personal health emergencies, people are much more focused on getting their loved ones to the best available heath care facility and rarely think about finances at that time. This feature ensures minimal downside and may be useful.Scenario – 5 – Buying an air ticket using credit cardWe usually buy international air tickets using credit card. As soon as I swipe the bank credit card to purchase an air ticket, bank sends an offer to client’s smart phone for preferred exchange rates for the trip if they buy foreign currency within a specific period. A preferred offer for travel insurance can also be provided.Scenario – 6 – Visit to the gas station.Most of us go to gas stations to top up regularly. Using location aware technology (already available) & mobile banking, the bank can identify that client is in a certain gas station and immediately send him targeted offer for using that bank’s specific credit / debit card there.Scenario – 7 –Targeted Reward ProgramsTo better understand consumer spending patterns and offer personalized reward programs, early adopter banks have started and are continuing to use analytics to offer customized and targeted rather than standard programs to customers. The ability to access data captured by smart devices of all kinds is helping these banks provide customers with a holistic view of their personal finances & spending patterns in real-time. Pairing IoT with analytics will also enable banks to provide location-based, real-time discounts. Using data and location driven insights, banks can anticipate customer needs and offer advice, products and solutions to help customers make smart and financially sound decisions.Banks are also starting to partner with different loyalty companies to reward customers for their purchases in real-time. This kind of IoT technology uses geographical data to identify offers and deals from nearby merchants that become active as soon as the customer swipes their debit or credit card at said merchant. Banks are increasingly under pressure to connect customers with other service providers such as retailers, insurance providers, health practitioners, airlines and hotels to deliver tailored offerings that meet customers’ needs and lifestyles.The use of big data & analytics in reward programs can potentially become a key differentiator for banks in the medium to long term.Concerns to be addressed:Such path-breaking & transformative innovations come with their own risks. This deluge of data can be quite challenging for financial organizations and they need to take a deep look at data management, data security, privacy standards and safeguards.  Few key concerns with come to mind are:Privacy: One of the concerns to deal with IoT is that all transactions are collected and stored. So, there is no privacy. For example : - Our smart phone, our smart watch all which have a GPS, will send your location details to banks or other companies to ensure organizations know your needs to perform focused sales.Data Security risk: Companies will keep collecting huge amounts of information, which includes even the smallest details and this makes it very important to ensure this data is stored properly with proper safeguards. We are all well aware of how much damage data hacking are loss of sensitive personal information can be for companies. Incorporating latest data security technology, taking sufficient preventive measures to ensure that information is secure will be key.Others: Industry regulations and red tape do exist in some areas. There are also issues with network & cloud infrastructure but it will be a matter of time these are ironed out.SummaryThe best part about the Internet of Things (IoT) is that possible applications are limitless. There can possibly be more than hundreds of other use cases that can improve the customer experience, provide more cross sell possibilities, reduce risk and increase operational efficiency which finally can improve the bank’s financial performance materially in the long run.Data is already being gathered in many instances. It's all about analyzing it in smarter ways and automatically taking proactive action at the exact right moment based on predictive analytics.While early adopter banks are increasingly turning to IoT to improve the customer experience, improve client stickiness and loyalty, gain market share and increase revenue -- improvements in overall network infrastructure, big data , analytics, cloud infrastructure & accessibility must mature before IoT can be implemented on a truly massive scale.Banks that continue to push the envelope in their technology adoption and encash on the huge IoT opportunity will be tomorrow’s market leaders. “The internet of things” opportunity has the potential to be the key differentiating factor in the long run between the visionaries, the also ran’s and the laggards.";otherFinance;http://www.finextra.com/blogs/fullblog.aspx?blogid=11676&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=finextrablogs
145;New Acura ad campaign gets personal about safetyIn a new safety-themed commercial, Acura wants to show that crash tests aren’t emotionless tasks.The spot, which begins airing nationally on Sunday, follows an Acura engineer as he preps for a test by delicately placing four lifelike dummies -- who are actually actors -- into the MDX crossover.Then there’s the twist.When the engineer finishes loading them into the vehicle and steps away, it’s revealed that he is the one in the driver’s seat. The engineer was visualizing himself and his family in place of the crash dummies the entire time.Acura wanted to take an emotional stance with the spot instead of going with the technical approach normally seen in auto safety ads, said Leila Cesario, national advertising manager for Acura. The tag line for the commercial is, “When you don’t think of them as dummies, something amazing happens.”Acura’s top safety engineers were consulted to ensure the ad accurately represented the test environment.“Our goal here is to talk about how personal it is,” Cesario said in an interview. “It’s beyond just passing a test.”The digital component of the campaign, which includes a landing page, launches today. The commercial was cut into 15-, 30- and 60-second spots.The ad highlights how Acura is the only brand to receive 5-Star vehicle honors in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s New Car Assessment Program and Top Safety Pick+ ratings from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety across its entire model line.The ad hit home for Acura’s engineers. Cesario said the engineers have a scrapbook in which they keep inspiring notes they receive from customers.Cesario said, “Before we even shot the ad, just talking about the ad, everyone here was emotional about it because everyone was very quickly able to relate to it.”;otherFinance;http://www.autonews.com/article/20151015/RETAIL03/151019925/new-acura-ad-campaign-gets-personal-about-safety
146;"Barclays launch new online banking hubBarclays have today announced the launch of iPortal, an online banking hub which helps customers of corporate organisations to have direct access to the entire range of services that the bank offers, using the Barclays Biometric Reader.Many have described the iPortal as an online gateway that will help companies have a clear view of their corporate banking structure as much as been done in the past to improve consumer banking and the corporate banking industry needs to be transformed also. Security has also been considered by Barclays due to the streamlined login process offered by the Barclays Biometric Reader.The iPortal will provide an immediate picture of accounts and products in a customisable function. Head of cash management at the bank, Michael Mueller, highlighted that it is time for change and moving in the right direction means getting rid of old technology.“Traditionally online banking systems have not always made life easy for businesses. Corporate banking solutions that bridge existing products produce disparate, complex and outdated systems that require multiple logins on a variety of platforms, making banking a time-consuming and disjointed process. With iPortal, we are changing that,” Mueller said.As a provider of real time alerts and notifications, the iPortal is set to revolutionise the economy worldwide because the system has the capability to present an overview of group balances across different business divisions in multiple countries. Alongside this, the system will use Hitachi’s Finger Vein Authentication Technology (VeinID) which scans the user’s finger blood flow to make payments and confirm transactions.Mueller comments upon the importance of customisation. “In recent years, banks have rolled out ever more personalised services, to meet consumer demands for ways of banking that fit around their lifestyle. But what’s to say the same idea can’t apply to business users? The development of iPortal is another major step towards our vision of the future of corporate banking; simplifying and personalising the experience to enable decision makers to spend more time focusing on the business of doing business.”In addition to increased security, this service will also help save financial professionals time as users are able to send messages to support and relationship teams within the bank and it will act as a market intelligence tool.Financial controllers and company executives will have access to the iPortal application and will be available to corporate customers immediately.

147;Just Offering Mobile Banking is Not EnoughMobile banking is moving to near universal availability, but customer uptake rates continue to remain relatively low according to a report from five of the Federal Reserve Bank districts.By Jim Marous, Co-Publisher of The Financial Brand and Publisher of the Digital Banking ReportAccording to a survey released from the Federal Reserve Banks of Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Minneapolis and Richmond, 78% of banks and credit unions offered mobile banking services in 2014, with an additional 16% planning to launch mobile offerings in the next one to two years. Despite this nearly universal availability, just 4% of financial institutions reported that more than half of their retail customers were enrolled and active users, while 80% reported that less than 20% are active mobile banking users.The survey found that mobile banking offerings are driven by the need to attract and retain customers and compete with other institutions. Financial organizations believed the biggest barriers to greater acceptance were the lack of consumer awareness and security concerns.The question is whether larger issues may be the cause, and whether these same issues may hamper the acceptance of mobile payments in the future.EHS Design | Experience Branding for Financial InstitutionsGrowth in Mobile UsageUsing smartphone penetration and usage as a key indicator of potential mobile banking and mobile payment adoption, research from ComScore has found that the percentage of the U.S. population over 13 years of age that owns a smartphone continues to increase, reaching 75.8% in 2015. This percentage has been growing steadily year over year and is forecasted to continue to rise.This increase in technological potential has resulted in new mobile banking functionality being introduced and new fintech players entering the marketplace. These drivers of change across the expanded mobile ecosystem are highly interconnected, and are pushing the window for innovation in the financial services industry.Furthering this potential has been the introduction of more powerful devices as well as improved contextual applications in other industries, such as travel, retail, hospitality and communication, connecting consumers to digital solutions 24/7/365 wherever the consumer wants to research or purchase products or services.Mobile Banking AvailabilityAccording to the survey, 78% of responding FIs offer mobile banking services, with 60% reporting that they have offered mobile banking for more than one year, and 18% reporting that they began offering such services within the past year. Unlike many other studies that include only top organizations, more than 80% of organizations surveyed had under $1B in assets, further illustrating the prevalence of mobile banking availability. There was uniformity between banks and credit unions with regard to offering mobile banking.Status_of_fis_offering_mobile_banking_by_us_financial_institutionsWhen looking at the support of various mobile banking platforms, all three platforms have increased over time as institutions expand their offerings to satisfy consumer requests. According to the study, 57% of the respondents use all three platforms to support mobile banking, although not all services are supported on every platform.In addition, in those cases where all three platforms are not supported, 36% of the FIs offer downloadable apps, 18% support mobile websites, and 8% offer SMS either singularly or in combination with another platform. It was found that more organizations are moving away from SMS except to support alerts, balances and limited transaction history.Finally, support of tablets has increased significantly, with 94% supporting the iPad platform, 71% supporting Android tablets and 25% supporting Kindle devices.Mobile Services OfferedTo determine the level of mobile banking support by financial institutions, the survey asked about 18 primary offerings, ranging from account and transaction information to funds transfer and payments. Five basic services were offered by about 75% of the organizations surveyed, with most of the remaining 25% planning to offer them by 2016. Five additional services were offered by at least half the institutions.Mobile_banking_features_offered_by_us_financial_institutions Three informational capabilities are considered standard for any mobile banking program – the ability to check DDA and savings account balances, the ability to view statements and transaction history, and the ability to locate ATMs and branches.;otherFinance;http://thefinancialbrand.com/53684/mobile-banking-payments-federal-reserve-study-2015/
148;Why Turkey is still the digital banking capital of the worldSo-called ‘traditional’ banks in Turkey are leading by example when it comes to innovation and resisting disruption from startups. Story by Devie Mohan.While 29 banks are in the race to get their licenses in the UK, including a sizable number of digital banks, Turkey – the social-media-based banking innovation hotbed of Europe – didn’t launch a single new bank in the past few years. Until earlier this month, that is, when BNP Paribas’ TEB launched its digital bank, CEPTETEB. In fact, the digitally obsessed Turkish millennials ensure that #cepteteb is a trending topic on Twitter (which is refreshing to see for someone in the UK, where bank Twitter handles are only used for complaining).Yet, why hasn’t there been a digital bank in Turkey sooner? The answer is quite simple: the so-called ‘traditional’ Turkish banks have been so innovative and customer-experience-friendly that they have been faring much better than the newly launched digital banks in other countries. The UK is notorious for its gaps in customer-centricity in banking offerings. In the US, only 23% of customers are happy with their banks.The ‘traditional’ bank Garanti, with its 12 million customers and 950 branches, launched special products targeting millennials, and ran education campaigns to get them started on current and savings accounts over a year ago. It integrated wallet, savings, loans and offers into a single access point, the iGaranti mobile app. The app even had a ‘conversation’ feature that enabled users to ask questions about their bank accounts.10 years before banks started fintech incubation and accelerator programs, Akbank, a $12bn local bank, launched an entrepreneurship program to encourage technology adoption related to banking. Turkey’s largest bank, IS Bank, lets customers withdraw cash without cards using QR codes on phones.The banks in Turkey have tried to make even the worst aspect of customer experience an experiment in digitalization. DenizBank started using iBeacon technology to provide a queue number as customers walked into the branch. One of the most hated banking procedures is loan application, so Akbank made this a tad more exciting by providing ‘credit kiosks’ that handle the loan process, right down to ID scanning and loan agreement printing.This wasn’t restricted to just the private banks. Ziraat Bank, the state-owned bank of Turkey, launched unstaffed video kiosks to replace teller counters, handling money, forex, bonds and bills (branch elimination at its finest!), proving that the market and the banks (as well as the customers) were ready to embrace digitalization in a big way in Turkey as far back as 2011.Turkey vs experience and capitalHello Bank logoThe CEPTETEB launch has come at an appropriate time, with the Turkish banking market seeing some unprecedented movements in the past month. BBVA has just become the leading shareholder in Garanti Bank, Turkey’s third largest bank. HSBC is currently in talks to sell its Turkish arm to ING Turkey. BBVA and BNP Paribas investing in the country is an interesting sign, as both have been the largest investors in fintech. BNP Paribas has already launched three digital banks worldwide (including Hello Bank in the UK), and BBVA has announced a venture capital fund to continue its ‘fintech spending spree’. It’s an interesting equation now, with Turkey’s own digital programs versus the larger banks’ experience and investments from outside Turkey.An example would be the recent agreements BNP Paribas has signed with Facebook, Google, LinkedIn and Twitter. These will definitely improve the way BNP Paribas TEB integrates digital media into its offerings. On the other hand, Garanti Bank has offered a Facebook-integrated mobile banking app, and Deniz Bank has been accepting loan applications via Twitter for about three years.The next step in the digital media war would be for both sets of banks to improve the scale of their offerings, ensuring it reaches the under-30 market of Turkey, which is over 50% of the total population today.Turkey is proof that the size of firms isn’t a barrier to innovation. It’s where traditional banks have learned to innovate, and at a faster pace and with less investment than most of its peers. It will work well for the new digital banks to give it the attention it deserves, and of course, learn from it!;otherFinance;http://banknxt.com/52422/turkey-digital-banking/
149;REMITTANCES EXPLAINED: How funds are transferred across borders, and why digital is poised to disrupt this century-old industryOver the past few centuries, the world has become increasingly globalized. Immigrants are pouring into developed countries like the US, where many jobs pay higher rates than in their home markets. As migrants shuffle around the globe, they have family members and friends back home who they continue to support through cross-border money transfers, called remittances.Three remittance companies — Western Union, MoneyGram, and Ria — have dominated this market for years, operating a combined 1.1 million retail locations across 200 countries to facilitate cash pickups. However, digital-first players are emerging, leveraging mobile and online platforms to compete with the legacy firms on scale and fees. Fees remain a huge pain point for migrants sending money home, and offering lower fees gives startups a huge advantage.In a new report from BI Intelligence, we size the total remittance market, the countries on both the send and receive sides that dominate remittance volume, and how remittances differ depending on payment mechanisms. We also look at the top challenges faced by remittance companies and what factors digital-first remittance startups are capitalizing on to disrupt the traditional remittance model.Don't be left in the dark: Stay ahead of the curve and access our full report to get everything you need to know about remittances.

150;Jonas Byström, senior sector specialist, water & waste management division, European Investment Bank (EIB) suggests ways to promote a circular ecomomy, including the introduction of new terminology. With a growing global population and increasing consumption, it is becoming more and more evident that we live beyond the means of the earth's finite resources and environmental carrying capacity. This is manifested not only by the often alarming effects of a disturbed environment and stressed climate, but also by the last decade’s rising resource prices that followed a century of falling prices. Together, these factors provide a strong case for steering away from the current linear take-make-use-dispose society towards a more circular economy, where, the utility and value of materials are maximised, their wastage throughout the value chain is minimised, and any waste generated is considered an asset rather than a liability.In the waste sector, the development towards a circular economy presents both challenges and opportunities. Waste managers should consider how best to adapt to and benefit from this new reality and contribute to its further realisation. A key challenge is to find ways to more firmly establish the view that our post-consumption discards are resources, whose management should fully reflect their inherent resource and energy value, also considering that this value will continue to increase in parallel to resource depletion.From waste to re-fuseIt has been argued that the first step towards integrated waste management is to stop calling it waste. On a similar note, it is sometimes stated that in a fully circular economy there is no waste, since all linear flows have been closed in circular material loops. Acknowledging this, the time seems right to substitute the negatively charged term waste with a new term that better reflects the resource value inherent in post-consumption discards.Since such discards could be viewed as resources after use, the term re-fuse is an option, also considering its allusion to a post consumption stage (“re“), to incorporation and integration (“fuse”), and to the circular economy mantra re-think. The adoption of a new term, such as re-fuse, which is used throughout this text for the sake of argument, would signal the transition from yesterday’s waste management, aimed at minimising environmental and health impacts and diverting waste from landfills, to tomorrow’s re-fuse exploitation in an increasingly circular economy.Re-fuse efficiencyIncreased re-fuse efficiency is an important aspect of a circular economy. During the last decades, EU directives and targets have contributed to reducing re-fuse generation, diverting re-fuse from landfills, and increasing re-fuse recycling and recovery. While many EU member states have achieved high recycling rates, others are struggling to reach double digit numbers, something which the Commission will consider in their revision of the Circular Economy Package presented by the last Commission in July 2014, and withdrawn by the new Commission in February 2015.The original package included among others proposals to raise recycling targets for municipal solid waste to 70% and for packaging waste to 80% by 2030. The revised proposal will reportedly have a wider focus than the old, and comprise smarter and more effective targets, some of which could also be country specific. The Commission has launched a public consultation on the subject that is open until 20th August 2015, and the revised proposal is expected to be presented by year-end.Irrespective of how future EU targets are set and formulated, there will always be a certain level of uncertainty in planning the capacity of residual re-fuse treatment facilities based on yet to be attained future diversion targets. There is thus a clear rationale first to aim at maximising re-fuse diversion, and, when and where necessary for target compliance, establish residual re-fuse treatment capacity.The road to re-fuse efficiencyTo increase re-fuse efficiency, further efforts must be made to increase both the quantity and the quality of recyclables extracted from re-fuse. This will reduce the dependency on imported raw materials in EU, and increase the resilience to diminishing supplies and increasing prices, with new jobs and economic growth as added benefits.On the recyclables supply side, separate collection infrastructure and related treatment facilities must be expanded and improved, and public awareness increased, in particular in countries where recycling rates are low today. Here, financial institutions like EIB have a responsibility to adapt their lending products and procedures to the financing needs of often small and less capital intensive re-fuse recycling and recovery projects comprising e.g. separate collection infrastructure, material recovery facilities, and composting and anaerobic digestion facilities.Framework loans, which enable the financing of groups of smaller projects of a particular type or in specific region, and intermediated lending, are appropriate for such types of projects. Through the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) under the Investment Plan for Europe, and through other dedicated instruments, EIB is also able to finance circular economy projects with a higher risk profile than under normal EIB operations.Targets and other push-like measures aside, it is being recognised that further recycling developments will also require pull-like mechanisms and measures that support the development of markets and boost demand for secondary raw materials extracted from re-fuse. Optional measures discussed include, for example, further focus on eco-design and green procurement, streamlining eco-label systems as means to build consumer awareness, and better exploiting various economic incentives such as differentiated VAT schemes or extended producer responsibility fee rebates on products or packaging that contain a certain share of secondary raw materials. Voluntary industry schemes for minimum recycled content in certain products or packaging, such as under the UK Dairy Roadmap, would also contribute to an increased demand for secondary raw materials.Looking further up in the value chain, product design and production planning should strive to improve material, water and energy efficiency, and increase the life and the potential for repair, dismantling and recycling of products.The opportunities in re-fuse efficiencyWhereas the transition to a re-fuse efficient circular economy era is justified by the necessity to adapt to an increasingly resource constrained reality, it should not be seen as a necessary burden, but as a logical development with the potential to create employment and economic growth in EU. Such a transition would be facilitated by a closer dialogue and co-operation among policy makers, industry and the re-fuse sector, where re-fuse managers could take a more proactive and pivotal role than is the case today. Actively promoting such a re-fuse efficient green growth seems like a sensible aspirational path for the re-fuse management sector in our developing circular economy.;otherFinance;http://waste-management-world.com/a/re-fuse-efficiency-in-a-circular-economy

153;"More than 13,000 jobs could be created if Northern Ireland moved to a circular economy, according to a new report launched today in Belfast.Produced by the ReNEW (Resource innovation Network for European Waste) network, in conjunction with non-profit Waste Resources Action Programme (WRAP), Job Creation in the Circular Economy — Increasing Resource Efficiency in Northern Ireland reveals that jobs could be created at various skill levels across Northern Ireland and within a number of sectors, including food and drink, biorefining and the bioeconomy. The role of renewable energy and smart energy grids in enabling development of manufacturing is also a key factor for achieving greater traction in realizing job growth potential.Funded by the European Regional Development, the £5 million ReNEW project (Resource innovation Network for European Waste), brings together researchers, public authorities and businesses in North West Europe to explore new ways to extract valuable resources — such as metal, nutrients and chemicals — from households and industrial waste. The report aims to encourage wider understanding of the potential of the circular economy for jobs growth, stimulating action to create the means by which the CE can fully support the economic aims for Northern Ireland.“Building a circular economy is a win-win for the economy and the environment,” said Environment Minister Mark H Durkan. “It makes sense to keep our natural resources in use for as long as possible through recovery, reuse, repair, remanufacturing and recycling. This can also drive economic growth by unlocking millions of pounds’ worth of value from materials used in key sectors in Northern Ireland. By departing from our traditional economic model of ‘make, use and dispose,’ we will be less vulnerable to dwindling natural resources, and increased price instability and energy costs.“We must work together, across government, and in partnership with business and the community, to ensure that the North is geared up to exploit the exciting opportunities afforded by a circular economy,"" Durkan added.The report echoes findings from an earlier study released by WRAP and Green Alliance in January — which found that the continued development of resource-efficient business activity, such as recycling, reuse and remanufacturing, could create demand for over 200,000 new jobs across Britain between now and 2030 — and projections from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation contending that over US$1 trillion a year could be generated for the global economy by 2025 and 100,000 new jobs created within the next five years if companies focused on building circular supply chains.";otherFinance;http://www.sustainablebrands.com/news_and_views/next_economy/sustainable_brands/report_circular_economy_could_create_over_13000_jobs_
154;On Monday, Dell announced additional progress against its circular economy initiatives, including the expansion of its closed-loop recycled plastic supply chain, introduction of reclaimed carbon-fiber source materials and new industry collaborations to advance global circular practices.In an industry first, Dell has partnered with supplier SABIC to recycle excess carbon fiber and scrap raw materials into new Dell products beginning in late 2015. Initially, select Latitude and Alienware products will contain recycled carbon fiber, with plans to expand across these two product portfolios in 2016. Dell estimates that by partnering with SABIC, it will prevent 820,000 pounds of carbon fiber from ending up in landfills. The recycled carbon fiber materials have an approximately 11 percent smaller carbon footprint than simply using virgin carbon fiber.Since Dell began pioneering its closed-loop recycled plastics supply chain in January 2014, the company has recycled 4.2 million pounds of closed-loop plastics into enclosures for new Dell products. These plastics were used in more than 30 flat panel monitor models and three Dell OptiPlex desktops available globally, with plans to scale across servers and other products in 2016. Dell’s process was certified by UL Environment as the first closed-loop supply chain, and continues to be the only one in the industry. Dell was also able to reduce its product carbon footprint via the closed-loop products by 11 percent and realized a cost savings over previous sources.“The technology industry has a unique responsibility to help shift the world to a circular economy model, and Dell’s long-standing investments in sustainable business puts us in a unique position to lead the way,” said Trisa Thompson, VP and chief responsibility officer at Dell. “We are always looking for collaborations that bring efficiencies to our business, and help our customers do the same.”;otherFinance;http://www.sustainablebrands.com/news_and_views/next_economy/sustainable_brands/dell_advances_circular_economy_model_industry-first_r
155;The new study analyses the waste composition of 15 European cities showing that 70 percent of municipal solid waste is product waste, and therefore not food or garden waste, and as such could be included under an EPR scheme. However, on average, only 45 percent of this product waste (by weight) is currently covered by producer responsibility schemes. This means that, on average, EPR schemes only cover 32.5 percent of total municipal waste, with coverage varying from 14.9 percent in Copenhagen to 47.6 percent in Paris. Furthermore, only 18 percent of product waste is collected separately through an EPR scheme.Joan-Marc Simon, director of ZWE said: “The current interpretation of EPR was useful to increase recycling rates in Europe over last 20 years but it will need updating for it to help move us towards a circular economy. We call on the European Commission to use the upcoming waste package to include incentives to redesign systems and products in order to drive prevention and reuse, foster a serviced-based economy, put recycling as last option and progressively phase out disposal.”The report makes a series of recommendations to the European Commission. Among these it calls for a broader definition and a more comprehensive approach to producer responsibility which includes the use of economic instruments. The introduction of legally binding eco-design requirements as well as better EPR schemes with full-cost coverage, individualisation, targets for separate collection and considering expansion of the current EPR scope to include more products and incentivise reuse.The study also finds that existing EPR schemes have been ineffective in driving eco-design, both because of its limited coverage of product waste and the lack of modulation of EPR fees based on eco-design. Zero Waste Europe urges the European Commission to develop minimum European-wide individualisation criteria based on eco-design.;otherFinance;http://recyclingportal.eu/Archive/18089

The partnership recognises Google’s commitment to developing innovative, market-leading circular economy initiatives at scale alongside the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s five existing Global Partners: Cisco, Kingfisher, Philips, Renault and Unilever.As industry leaders, Global Partners work closely with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation to identify circular business opportunities and to implement tangible programmes.As a global front-runner in technology innovation, Google is ideally placed to play a key enabling role in bringing about the system-level change needed to accelerate the transition to a circular economy.Ellen MacArthur – “Google’s ambition to lead the way on the circular economy represents a step-change opportunity – we are thrilled to be working closely together with such a visionary, innovative and transformational partner on this journey”Google has an extensive global network of data centres and real estate, a strong presence in the electronic devices market, and arguably the world’s leading data and analytics capability.It will build on an already impressive track record in energy efficiency and resource effectiveness to become a pioneer and global reference point for many aspects of the circular economy.Over the coming months, the Foundation and Google will be working to explore and shape a series of initiatives to embed circular economic principles into the fabric of Google’s infrastructure, operations, and device programmes.Ellen MacArthur commented: “Google’s ambition to lead the way on the circular economy represents a step-change opportunity – we are thrilled to be working closely together with such a visionary, innovative and transformational partner on this journey.”Circular Economy 100The Foundation also announced that Dell is the latest corporate to join the Circular Economy 100 (CE100) membership.Dell is a multinational computer technology company headquartered in Texas, United States.

157;Laptops made of plastic from old laptops. Aluminium car body parts made from old cars. Chemicals leased out, recovered, and leased again. These are just a few examples of how the circular economy, once seen as a Scandinavian speciality, is starting to spin in the United States.What’s driving the circular economy in the US? Economics, for one. “It’s cost efficient and carbon efficient,” says Carrie Majeske, manager of global sustainability integration at Michigan-based Ford, explaining why the auto manufacturer is boosting recycled aluminium content. “It helps insulate us from oil price volatility,” adds Nigel Stansfield, global chief innovations officer at flooring supplier, Interface. The Atlanta-based company recovers nylon from its used carpet tiles, and sends it back into its supply chain. David Lear, executive director of corporate sustainability at Dell, which has started a closed loop plastic recovery system, says that the Texan company uses 10m kg of plastic in their computers each year. “Using recovered plastic instead of virgin material definitely saves us money,” he says. How cities are innovating towards a circular economy   Read more   Market opportunities also play a part in driving the circular economy and they have spawned a clutch of new businesses, explains Andrew Morlet, CEO of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. He cites New York’s Ecovative, which has developed a packaging material grown from mushrooms. “They take biowaste – like sawdust and crop products – put it into moulds and grow mushroom roots around them.” It forms robust packaging which “can be chucked on the garden as compost”. The company is working on compostable plasterboard, too.Purists might point out that this isn’t strictly a closed loop. But in the sense of putting what would otherwise be waste back into nature’s resource chain, it is certainly circular. It’s a compromise Interface learnt early, says Stansfield. “Recycling an old carpet tile into a new carpet tile sounds good, but it’s not always the most practical solution. We took a biomimicry approach: nature recycles everything [but] it doesn’t necessarily remanufacture.”A growing interest in zero waste is also propelling companies down the circle line, says Morley: “People are exploring automated exchanges for post-industrial byproducts, a bit like the industrial symbiosis programmes in Europe.” Reducing the burden – regulatory or otherwise – of managing your waste stream plays a part, too. “General Motors is looking at leasing models for chemicals. Instead of buying the solvents they need, using them, then having to work out what to do with them, they can lease them from specialist suppliers who then recover them, clean them and put them out into the market again.”Many of these motives echo those which have seen the circular economy gain momentum in Europe, but there are some distinctive American aspects, too – not least, politics. Sun, sand, sea and circular economy?   Read more   “Talking about climate change, or even resource scarcity, is much more politically loaded in the US than Europe,” says Sally Uren, CEO of Forum for the Future. For companies nervous of venturing into such sensitive territory, the circular economy is reassuringly neutral. “It’s branded with a clear business case: if you reuse this stuff and save waste, it will save you money. And no-one can argue with that,” Uren says.That said, there are some chunky barriers on the roundabout. The American economy is still largely neophiliac: people like and trust new stuff, and can’t quite believe what’s gone around will be as good. At Ford, Carrie Majeske talks of the struggle to get recycled material included in technical specifications, for example of car bumpers. “We’re trying to make sure we get more into each vehicle each year,” she says. There’s an element of conservatism too. “We don’t have the same regulatory framework as Europe,” says John Atcheson, founder of Stuffstr, an app-based initiative to encourage consumers to maximise the lifetime of their purchases. “And we don’t have companies who have embraced it as a broad strategic objective – like Philips, or Kingfisher, or M&S.”What could increase the revolutions?Regulation is, unsurprisingly, high on the list, particularly for the role it can play in ensuring a decent supply. “We need a reliable, high quality material feed-stream,” says Majeske. “That needs the right policies and the right investment. It starts with the municipalities. If they have a mixed stream recycling system [avoiding the need for consumers to separate waste] that’s a big plus.” The three SDGs Philips is focusing on for a better world   Read more   Stansfield agrees: “California’s put a levy on flooring materials [to encourage] end-of-life uses. Thanks to that, we’ve been able to set up hubs in that state to be key suppliers to Interface.” Similar legislation across the US would drive the market, he believes.Certification helps, too. Stansfield points to the way the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) system for buildings has stimulated Interface’s market, by including the use of post-consumer recycled materials as key criteria.But the biggest boost might come from technological innovations now under way – particularly the internet-of-things. “That will create much more active tracking of materials, and that can create business models which simply were not affordable before,” predicts Morlet.As companies start to embrace circularity they start to see their supply lines differently. “Instead of a linear chain, people are thinking in terms of value networks,” says Uren.America might have been slow off the blocks, but Morley is confident it’s catching up. “We’ll see some big players start to do significant things in this space, and provide real industry leadership. And increasingly, we’ll see government bodies looking to enable that to happen, and remove some of the regulations which get in its way.”;otherFinance;http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/aug/26/how-the-circular-economy-is-taking-off-in-the-us

Circular business models thrive on longevity, reuse and capacity sharing — they disrupt, uncover customer value and drive resource efficiency. (If you want to learn more about how the circular economy is changing the way business thinks, check out this round-up.) Many would agree that society needs to adopt this circular thinking, but how do we really make it happen at large?The truth is, several players are required to accelerate the journey to a more circular economy; it can't be achieved by certain echelons of society alone. Instead it requires a holistic view of the diverse role business, public bodies and investors all have to play to accelerate the uptake of circular principles; a belief reflected in the categories of The Circulars 2016 this year.Each of the eight categories for 2016 have been designed to recognize the groups and individuals that we need to push the agenda forward, and reward those already leading by example by giving them global recognition for their work, whilst helping to inspire others.

Diebold, based in North Canton, Ohio, is behind the iris-scanning biometric technology. The company has teamed up with Citigroup, though the bank doesn't have immediate plans to bring the technology to market yet. Some consumers who are testing these ATMs said they are wary of the new technology. ""There was some concern with registering the iris,"" said David Kuchenski, who oversees Diebold's business development of innovation. ""It comes down to how you portray to the consumer. If it’s very sci-fi, it’s less appealing. Some people were uncomfortable with scanning their iris, but okay with registering their fingerprints."" The concept requires that consumers register their credentials and agree to have their irises scanned, which could potentially be completed at the terminal itself. ""I like to think of it as a high-res photo of the face,"" said Kuchenski. ""To me, if you think about the old sci-fi movies where the person looks into the iris scanner, that experience is very intimidating to the consumer.

161;Over the past couple of years, ATMs have taken a Darwinian leap forward in technology, adding new capabilities from cash and check image deposit and video teller capabilities to biometric identification and card-free access with smartphones. These advancements now make the ATM the ideal centerpiece of an omnichannel banking strategy.Omnichannel banking is designed to offer access to financial services across a variety of channels and to introduce more consistent interactions with the banking brand across all touch points — from the branch to Internet, call center and mobile banking to the new ATMs, kiosks and assisted self-service devices.According to Synergistics, 37 percent of ATM users see the ATM as the primary banking channel. This makes the ATM the ideal channel for cross-selling, upselling, and increasing brand awareness, which will result in increased customer loyalty with a higher retention rate as well as the probability of acquiring new customers.The new self-service economyToday's newer ATMs, kiosks and assisted self-service devices perfectly align with the increasingly popular self-service and online channels used across so many businesses and industries.The adoption and widespread use of self-service channels has become a vital addition to the U.S. economy. Today we find supermarket shoppers using self-service checkout registers, gas-buyers paying at the pump, airline passengers checking in at self-service kiosks and business travelers checking out using hotel kiosks.The majority of consumers now trust self-service options to offer a superior transaction process and businesses see them as an integral component of their customer service and revenue generation strategies.And this is where the branch transformation and omnichannel strategy fit so well around the ATM.Financial institutions are looking to cut costs while increasing their revenues — but without diminishing customer experience. In the current competitive market, it is vital for retail banks to find a way to reduce the cost of providing services — and at the same time to exceed customer expectations.Adding value via positive customer experienceFrom transaction personalization to customized one-to-one marketing offers, today's ATMs have become extremely valuable customer relationship and marketing vehicles that generate economic value through positive experiences and greater customer convenience.As more and more people use online banking and ATM channels, banks encounter fewer face-to-face opportunities to cross-sell new services to customers.

""The best interest of the client is critical to our successes in this market and that is a core value for MVB. We have taken our time to find the very best people and talent in the market and as we open our doors today, people will see the MVB difference and it will set us apart.""    Over the last three years, MVB has completed a series of strategic initiatives to enter into the Northern Virginia market. In 2012, the company acquired Potomac Mortgage Company, now MVB Mortgage. MVB Mortgage, the bank's wholly-owned subsidiary currently operates in numerous locations including Fairfax, McLean, Ashburn, and Washington D.C. In 2014, MVB assembled an experienced and knowledgeable lending team, led by Nalls, to establish the MVB Commercial Lending Company, a loan production office serving the Northern Virginia market.  ""MVB's expansion into Northern Virginia just makes sense in our growth plan and fits well with the successes of our mortgage company,"" Mazza said. ""We've taken a very systematic approach to our growth by first building relationships in these different geographic areas and then opening up a full service financial center location that reflects the needs of our clients. This new financial services center in Reston represents a crucial key to our future expansion.""   In 2015, MVB Bank, the SBA Community Bank of the Year in the State of West Virginia, has launched five other banking locations, including new banking offices in Fairmont, West Virginia, at the I-79 Technology Park; in downtown Charleston, West Virginia; and in two acquired locations in the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia, just outside the Washington, D.C. metro area.    ""We have built a lot of momentum in Northern Virginia through the leadership of Ed Dean, Jamie Nalls and their teams,"" Mazza said, ""We are excited about this new Reston branch location and how it fits into our plan for the future.""

172;JPMorgan Chase failed to meet investor expectations with its third quarter results on Tuesday, October 13, as the country’s largest bank witnessed a notable reduction in revenues for each of its core operating divisions year-on-year as well as quarter-on-quarter. The sub-par operating performance was dragged down further by firm-wide legal expenses in excess of $1.3 billion – a figure which was elevated by the bank’s $595 million settlement of its credit default swap litigation. The bottom line was rescued by a one-time tax gain of $2.2 billion.While JPMorgan’s lukewarm Q3 performance points to a weak quarter for the banking industry as a whole, several positive trends can be discerned from the results. The most important among these is the reduction in total non-interest expenses (adjusted for one-time events) for yet another quarter. JPMorgan’s adjusted costs for Q3 2015 were $14 billion – down from $14.2 billion in Q2 2015 and around $14.5 billion a year ago. Also, the bank’s net interest margin unexpectedly rose for a second consecutive quarter to 2.16%. Finally, the mortgage and card businesses may have fallen short on revenues, but they reported a sizable improvement in their level of activity – something that will be key to profits over subsequent quarters.We maintain a $71 price estimate for JPMorgan’s shares, which is about 15% ahead of the current market price.See our full analysis of JPMorganDebt Trading Weighs On Investment Banking BusinessJPMorgan reported total revenues of $8.2 billion for its corporate and investment banking division, which includes its advisory, underwriting, trading, treasury and securities services operations. This compares to a figure of $8.7 billion for Q2 2015 and a substantially higher $9.1 billion for Q3 2014. The year-on-year reduction is almost completely accounted for by a reduction in fixed income trading revenues. JPMorgan reported FICC (fixed income, currency and commodities) trading revenues of $2.9 billion for Q3 2015 – a good 23% lower than the $3.8 billion figure a year ago. This is worse than the expected decline of 5-10% year-on-year.

173;"British bank Virgin Money today reported a surge in mortgage lending as it benefits from strength in the housing market.The bank said that gross mortgage lending was up 38% to £5.5 billion in the nine months to the end of September. Virgin Money, which counts itself among the bigger ""challenger"" banks taking on established players such as Lloyds and Barclays, said its mortgage market share had risen to 3.5% in the first eight months, the most recent Bank of England figures available. That compares with the 2.8% figure given in its most recent annual report. The bank, which went public last year having changed its name from Northern Rock, said net mortgage lending almost doubled in the first nine months of the year to £2.6 billion from a year earlier. The British housing market has been buoyant this year and industry body the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors last month doubled its forecast for house price gains this year to 6%.Virgin Money, backed by founder Richard Branson and US financier Wilbur Ross, is looking beyond mortgages and said demand for its recently launched credit cards had exceeded expectations. It is also evaluating plans for services to small and medium-sized businesses, or SMEs.Analysts said the bank's growth had been stronger than anticipated, especially in credit cards, and this could led to upgrades of around 5% in earnings forecasts. The bank has hired George Ashworth, managing director of ABN AMRO Lease's UK branch, to develop an SME banking strategy. Having received enquiries from small business owners over the past few years, ""it's a natural step for the brand,"" Virgin Money's chief executive Jayne-Anne Gadhia told Reuters. Gadhia also said the bank was expecting a moderate increase in interest rates, most likely towards the end of 2016. The Bank of England as a whole is edging closer to an interest rate hike, but voted eight to one last month to keep rates on hold. Gadhia also reiterated the bank's view on free in-credit banking.

175;New Central Bank governor Philip Lane may face the challenge of an overheating housing market here and whether even stricter controls will be required to rein in home loan credit.Finance Minister Michael Noonan yesterday named Mr Lane to succeed Patrick Honohan when he retires as governor later this year.Mr Lane holds the Whately chair of political economy and is head of economics at TCD. More than 100 candidates were identified during an international recruitment search campaign, the finance minister said.The appointment was in the end a two-horse race between Prof Lane, who has built an international reputation with global institutions such as the ECB, IMF, and World Bank and Robert Watt, a former international economics consultant who had huge experience of running a complex organisation in his current post as secretary general of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.Prof Lane’s appointment therefore extends the new practise of appointing from outside Government departments. Mr Honohan, who was appointed at the height of the crisis had also built international academic career at TCD.Before the crisis exposed the huge failings of banking regulation, Central Bank governors were former civil servants.Prof Lane was known as displaying a keen knowledge of the bond market pressures facing Ireland as the bailout loomed and being a very good reader of the troika’s intentions.However, experts say the major challenge he will have will be to face down the waves of industry and political pressure for the Central Bank to loosen its mortgage lending restrictions, as a general election looms.The new rules restrict mortgage loans to 90% and 80% of the property’s worth for first- and second-time buyers.Leading economists believe he will face a more severe test if the housing crisis here is not quickly resolved.Other countries face similar concerns and international regulators may be persuaded to restrict housing credit even further, to help prevent disastrous property market bubbles emerging once again around the world.Focus will also fall on the comments he made to the banking inquiry earlier this year, when he said a “fiscal reserve fund” sourced initially from the Central Bank surpluses could have helped to recapitalise banks.The fund would have been different from the National Pension Reserve Fund, which had to be sold down rapidly during the crisis.Prof Lane is well known and respected at the higher levels of IMF, the ECB, and World Bank, from his work on globalisation of capital flows, academics say. He was appointed by ECB President Mario Draghi to chair the Advisory Scientific Committee of the European Systemic Risk Board.;otherFinance;http://www.irishexaminer.com/business/new-central-bank-governor-to-face-pressure-on-mortgages-360528.html
176;British mortgage approvals declined in September for the first time in four months, but mortgage lending and consumer credit grew at the fastest rate in years, Bank of England data showed on Thursday.Mortgage approvals for house purchases numbered 68,874 in September, down from a recent of 70,664 in August. Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast 72,450 mortgage approvals were made last month.Reflecting strong past mortgage approvals and buoyant consumer morale, overall lending grew at the fastest rate since December 2008, powered by robust growth in both mortgage lending and consumer credit.Mortgage lending rose 3.595 billion pounds on the month, the biggest net increase since April 2008, and amounting to annual growth of 2.2 percent -- the biggest rise since January 2009.Consumer credit also beat expectations on the month, and chalked up annual growth of 8.2 percent, the fastest increase since February 2006. British economic growth slowed more than expected in the three months to September, and economists are unsure about the extent to which strong consumer demand will offset a weakening global outlook.A survey from mortgage lender Nationwide on Thursday showed house price growth rose 0.6 percent on the month, slightly more than expected. Most housing market data has pointed to renewed momentum in house prices, after a hiatus in the latter part of 2014 due to tighter mortgage regulation. Last month the BoE's Financial Policy Committee said it expected house price inflation to pick up in the coming months and would be closely monitoring Britain's so-called buy-to-let market, dominated by small landlords.;otherFinance;http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/10/29/uk-britain-lending-idUKKCN0SN10J20151029
177;" Restricting the size of a mortgage to a multiple of a homeowner's income  proposed by Treasury would hinder, not help, the Auckland housing market the Property Institute says.Ashley Church, chief executive of the institute, said debt-to-income mortgage restrictions could lead to an artificial boom in apartments and could cut first-home buyers even more greatly out of the market if they were introduced.""The effect of such a policy would be to limit a typical Auckland family to a mortgage of less than $400,000,"" Church said, citing similar rules in the UK where most home buyers were restricted to 4.5 times their annual income.The concept has been spurred by the release of Treasury documents, supporting the Reserve Bank's intervention in the Auckland housing market but suggesting alternatives to loan-to-value ratios (LVRs).Under LVRs, most borrowers have to have a set percentage of the house's value as their deposit.At present that hurdle is 20 per cent, but on November 1, it becomes 30 per cent for investors in Auckland, while restrictions loosen up for more low-deposit lenders outside Auckland.Treasury said one of the unintended consequences of the LVRs was that it had shut many first home buyers out of the market.""LVR limits target one aspect of loan sustainability, that is, credit loss given default.""Debt-to-income limits were an alternative way ""of managing financial system vulnerability by targeting the likelihood of default.""Church said the Reserve Bank had previously confirmed it was collecting loan-to-income data from the banks, but debt-to-income mortgages would almost certainly make the Auckland housing crisis worse.""Ad Feedback  He said the fallout could include:- Fuelling an artificial boom in apartment construction - caused by the fact that it was the only building most people could now afford.- Putting up further barriers to first-home buyers.- Prompting house listings to fall because home owners would choose to hang on to their properties rather than accept much lower prices for them.- Stopping infill development, and possibly large scale development, because developers were also caught in the new restrictions.The Reserve Bank on Thursday ""left interest rates unchanged at 2.75 per cent, but said Auckland house price rises remain strong, ""posing a financial stability risk"".Labour's housing spokesman Phil Twyford called on the Government to rule out debt-to-income mortgages.""Such measures in England and Ireland have curbed skyrocketing housing prices but they have come at a price - they've locked first home buyers further and further out of the market.""With the median Auckland house price of $771,00 already nearly the equivalent of 10 times the median household income, few people will be able to buy into the market.""";otherFinance;http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/money/73479221/aucklands-housing-boom-could-worsen-under-proposed-mortgage-rules-valuers
178;Bankers are becoming a little less fussy about the credit scores they demand from people who want to buy or refinance houses.In September, the average FICO score fell to 723 for people approved for a mortgage, according to a report from Ellie Mae, a firm that tracks mortgage applications and approvals.A 723 score is still no easy hurdle because it demands that people have a far better record than the average person in paying their bills and controlling debts. But it's the lowest average score since August 2011, suggesting that lenders are becoming slightly more lenient about granting mortgages. At the end of last year, the average score approved for a mortgage was 757.With lending requirements far more stringent since the housing bust and financial crisis of 2008, many Americans have been left out of the housing market, especially first-time homebuyers. Coming up with sizable down payments has been one issue, and student loans have also dogged young adults. Meanwhile, credit scores of many people fell as they struggled to make mortgage payments and lost jobs.The average FICO score for American adults was 695 in April, the latest number released by Fair Isaac Corp., which disseminates the FICO scores to lenders evaluating mortgage and other credit applications. So most people have scores far below the 723 average that lenders have been approving for mortgages.But scores have been improving slowly since the depths of the housing crisis and recession. In October 2009, the average FICO score was 686, according to Fair Isaac. FICO scores range from 300 to 850, with 850 the highest and an indication that a person is likely to make their loan payments.The number of people with scores of 800 or above has been rising recently, with about 19.9 percent scoring at that level, according to Fair Isaac. There are also fewer people at the low level of 550 compared to the recessionary period in 2009, but Fair Isaac says some of the improvement in the 550 range comes because people were so troubled with debt they've fallen out of the analysis.The latest 695 average FICO was the highest since 2005, when housing issues first started to show up.Less stringent credit requirements recently have been allowing more people to refinance as well as buy new homes. Ellie Mae reports that refinances represented 42 percent of the loans approved. In addition, the lengthy process of getting approved for a mortgage has been declining.;otherFinance;http://www.idahostatesman.com/homes/article41206398.html
179;In the hopes of preventing another crisis like the one that led to the Great Recession six years ago, new Federal regulations go into effect this month requiring that borrowers receive more transparent mortgage disclosure forms, which will spell out loan terms in unprecedented detail. And while some aspects of the new rules—especially a requirement that gives borrowers more time to review the numbers—could help improve financial decision making, others will likely do little to change home buyers’ behavior. Research by behavioral economists shows that when it comes to keeping people from making financial mistakes, adding more transparency probably won’t help people make better choices__ .Contrary to what you might think (and what many regulators would have you believe) “providing people with more information doesn’t help” when it comes to helping people choose a healthier path says Dan Ariely, author of ‘Predictably Irrational’ and professor of behavioral economics at Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business.ADVERTISINGIn a study published in ‘Health Affairs’ in 2012, Ariely and his former colleague Janet Schwartz tested the effect of calorie labeling in consumption at a Chinese fast-food restaurant. To examine how increased information would impact diners’ behavior, they instructed servers to ask customers if they wanted to reduce the portion size of three “starchy” dishes. Consistently, less than 1/3 of customers took the offer—even if they were provided with a financial incentive—like reduced pricing—for doing so. Calorie labeling “had no measurable impact on ordering behavior,” according to the study. “If anything, the downsizing offer was less effective in changing customers’ ordering patterns with the calorie labeling present,” they wrote.“Giving people more information about calorie labeling does almost nothing to change their behavior,” Ariely says. The same, he says, is true for money. “In the case of investment and savings, teaching people what’s called financial literacy does very little to change their behavior__;otherFinance;http://www.forbes.com/sites/elizabethharris/2015/10/27/no-washington-more-mortgage-information-probably-wont-help-borrowers/

181;"Coming into force in March next year is the EU Mortgage Credit Directive, and it is likely to have a significant impact on many who work in the City. It has a variety of implications, including for buy-to-let mortgages, but least well-understood is how it will affect the provision of mortgages for people who receive some or all of their income  in currencies other than sterling; for instance, bonuses denominated in US dollars. Alongside important new consumer protections, the rules are likely to see a large number of traditional lenders leave the market for clients that earn all or part of their income in a foreign currency. Earning money in two or more currencies is not as unusual as it sounds. If you work in investment banking or even a large corporate, it is quite common to receive a bonus in dollars or euros, on top of your salary in sterling.  How does this affect your ability to take out a mortgage? It comes down to the affordability assessment. If you’re borrowing £1m and have a £350,000 annual salary in sterling, your income will likely be judged sufficient to enable you to repay the mortgage without needing to access your foreign currency income. But under the new Mortgage Credit Directive rules, if you receive income or hold assets in a currency other than that in which the loan is denominated (most relevantly the euro and the Swiss franc), your mortgage could be deemed to be a currency mortgage.  Until recently, many people in Eastern Europe took out mortgages denominated in Swiss francs, as the currency was perceived to be more stable. But when the Swiss National Bank removed the Swiss franc’s peg with the euro earlier this year, the real cost of their mortgages increased dramatically, as the Swiss franc surged in value against the currency their salary was paid in. While exposure from sharp currency movements will continue to exist, lenders will be obliged to alert their clients that movements have occurred. The new rules are intended to provide greater protection for borrowers who may be exposed to sharp currency movements.   The Mortgage Credit Directive requires lenders to put in place measures to alert borrowers to foreign exchange risk that they may be exposed to. There are conditions attached to this: you are not allowed to simply convert the mortgage into another currency whenever you want to. A lender will have two options on how they chose to comply: either give the right to convert the currency of the mortgage to an alternative currency; or make available other arrangements that limit the risks to the customer of foreign currency fluctuations. There is an expectation that this new rule will see many traditional high street lenders moving out of the currency mortgage market. The FCA consultation on the Directive saw some consumer and industry stakeholders argue that it would have the counter-productive outcome of causing firms to stop lending and thereby reduce customer access. This doesn’t mean that currency mortgages will no longer be offered. It is, however, likely that they will increasingly only be available from private banks like Investec.";otherFinance;http://www.cityam.com/227279/investec-comment-new-mortgage-rules-affect-dual-currency-earners
182;"New regulations recently implemented in the mortgage market have put loan applications on a roller-coaster ride that just keeps going. Total application volume increased 11.8 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis last week from the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Last week's results include an adjustment for the Columbus Day holiday. The jump follows two weeks of sharp moves in opposite directions due new mortgage disclosure rules for lenders. The rules went into effect Oct. 3, so applications increased dramatically just before the deadline, then plummeted, and now are back up again, although not quite as sharply. ""We expect that application volume will remain volatile over the next few weeks as the industry continues to implement TILA-RESPA integrated disclosures,"" said Mike Fratantoni, the MBA's chief economist, referring to the the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974. Refinance volume increased 9 percent from the previous week on a seasonally adjusted basis. Purchase applications increased 16 percent from a week earlier and are now 9 percent higher than the same week one year ago. A drop in interest rates may have helped juice the volume. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances ($417,000 or less) decreased to 3.95 percent, the lowest level since May, from 3.99 percent, with points decreasing to 0.43 from 0.53 (including the origination fee) for 80 percent loan-to-value ratio loans. Another driver of volume was in the government loan categories. FHA, VA and Rural Home Loans saw big increases, although there appears to be no clear reason why. These loans do have the lowest down payment requirements, so the surge could be a signal that first-time buyers, who are historically more plentiful in the fall, are finally returning to the housing market. The Mortgage Bankers Association, which is holding its annual convention this week, released its latest projections for mortgage originations in 2016. It expects a steady increase in purchase applications but a large drop in refinances, likely due to the expectation for higher interest rates. ";otherFinance;http://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/21/
183;"Mortgage applications plummeted 27.6 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis for the week that ended Friday from the previous week, the Mortgage Bankers Association said Wednesday. The drop comes as no surprise, given the 25.5 percent jump the week before, just ahead of the implementation of new mortgage disclosure rules (which go by the acronym TRID). Lenders had to make major changes to their loan processing systems, and the fear was that this would slow applications; borrowers, therefore, rushed to get applications in before the rules went into effect on Oct. 3.

184;UAE residents are showing an increasing preference for products tailored to the more cost-conscious consumer, a new report shows. This is evident in the latest ranking by financial comparison site Souqalmal.com analysing the most viewed products – credit cards, personal loans, car loans and home loans, over the period extending between April and September, 2015. Reaffirming this consumer choice, Union National Bank’s house rent loan gets the top rank amongst the most popular personal loans in UAE. The popularity of this loan, available to those earning a minimum monthly salary of Dh10,000 with no salary transfer requirement, shows that consumers are searching for products that help them meet their day-to-day living costs more effectively, Souqalmal.com said in a report shared with Emirates 24|7. A similar pattern emerged in the car loans category, which was topped by Dubai Islamic Bank (DIB) with its Al Islami Used Car Finance offering, available to those earning Dh3,000 at a reducing rate of 5.14 per cent, followed closely by ADIB with its Used Car Finance Murabaha product. This more frugal approach to personal finance was also demonstrated in the credit cards category, with three of the top five most popular credit cards available at Zero annual fee, the financial comparison site said. The Cashback Blue card in fourth position from Majid Al Futtaim Finance (Najm) and the TouchPoints Titanium Credit Card with MyChoice from ADCB in fifth place also offer customers rewards on their spending, without charging any annual fee. Also taking the top spot in the ranking was Amex, which saw its feature-packed American Express Platinum Credit Card leading the credit cards category. Available to those earning over Dh22,250, the card comes with an annual fee of Dh700. For the fifth time in a row, Adib’s Home Finance for Expats product led the way on the home loans front. The Home finance product is available to those earning over Dh15,000 at a reducing rate of 2.99 per cent. This was one of five appearances made by the Islamic financial institution in Souqalmal.com’s latest list. In a statement, Souqalmal.com said its team compiles the quarterly ranking from the most viewed products across the four categories: Credit cards, personal loans, home loans and car loans. Financial products only secure a placement on the top-five list if they receive the most number of views from Souqalmal’s website visitors, it noted.“We release this list for exactly this reason – to find out the latest trends in the country’s retail banking sector and to provide greater transparency in the market overall,” said Ambareen Musa, founder and CEO of Souqalmal.com.“Consumers are searching for products that help them to better manage their financial affairs at a time when the increasing cost of living is not being adequately matched by salary rises”.This is the sixth list of its kind released by the financial comparison website – interestingly, only 10 financial institutions made the cut in this round, less than the 13 that were featured in the last half-yearly assessment.“Evidently, some banks are becoming savvier at delivering products that customers actually want – upping their game in what they offer to ensure they garner the most attention from UAE customers,” added Musa.  “Consumers always want to know what everybody else is buying into. So if a particular loan or credit card is attracting a lot of attention, others will want to find out about it,” she said.;otherFinance;http://www.emirates247.com/news/emirates/uae-s-most-popular-car-loan-for-dh3k-earners-rent-loan-for-dh10k-earners-2015-10-29-1.608594
185;Sri Lanka's Central Bank will is to allow banks and finance companies to give loans up to 90 percent of the value of a car, up from a recently tightened 70 percent, by an order to be released today, the Finance Ministry said. Though Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said the Central Bank, which is the banking regulator will relax the rule it did not happen, and a recent circular which limited the LTV value to 70 percent remained in effect. Sri Lanka's central bank which triggered balance of payments trouble in 2015 with loose monetary policy when fiscal policy had already deteriorated is trying to control credit to cars, in a bid to save foreign exchange. The Central Bank has generated forex shortages from within two years of its creation, and slammed foreign exchange controls on the people while other authorities have placed price controls and also rationed goods to the people, generating black markets. Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake told reporters that LTV value would be relaxed because the Central Bank will increase a deposit on car import letters of credit to 100 percent. A direction on the LC deposit increase had also not come yet. Increasing the deposit on import letters of credit is an exchange control or 'multiple currency practice' which is in violation of Article VIII obligations Sri Lanka has signed with the International Monetary Fund. The IMF was created by US interventionist including Harry Dexter White, who was later sacked from the US Treasury as a suspected Soviet spy.   The IMF was created to bailout countries who joined the failed Bretton Woods soft-peg system, whose architects knew that central banks who tried to control interest rates by printing money would run into foreign exchange shortages. Sri Lanka abandoned a stable currency board (hard peg) and joined the IMF a day after the Central Bank law came into effect and has suffered high inflation and balance of payments crises since then;otherFinance;http://www.economynext.com/Sri_Lanka_Central_Bank_to_relax_car_loan_to_value_ratio__Finance_Ministry-3-3372.html
186;Unlike a home, a car will lose tremendous value the moment you drive it off the lot — yet you’ll still be stuck with a full price loan to pay down.Home equity loans or lines of credit offer tax deductible interest, so that seems like a huge draw. But the flexibility of home payments means you may be stuck paying for the car for far longer than you own it.The amortization of most home equity loans is between 15 and 25 years, said Debra Morrison, a certified financial planner with Empowered Retirement in Lincoln Park, N.J.“Unless you will be disciplined to repay an equal dollar payment to your home equity loan that you otherwise paid to the car loan repayment, you’ll be extending indebtedness for a hugely depreciating asset, your car,” Morrison said.To that point, the amount of loan interest that is otherwise deductible is minimal, she said, especially given the long-term amortization of a home equity loan.“When the monthly home equity loan statement shows your minimum payment, there may be a temptation to begin paying just that lower payment amount, hence I recommend resisting the temptation and continue to pay your car payment, on schedule, thus leaving your home equity loan available for larger opportunities, preferably for appreciating asset investments,” she said.;otherFinance;http://blog.credit.com/2015/10/should-i-pay-off-my-car-loan-with-my-home-equity-127857/
187;The attempt to sort that out is the end result of a unique settlement in which Ally agreed to pay borrowers at least $80 million to settle allegations of racial or ethnic discrimination, even though the lender is prohibited by law from collecting data on the race or ethnicity of its borrowers. Ally, formerly known as GMAC and spun off from  General Motors GM -2.64 %      in 2006, didn’t admit or deny wrongdoing as part of the 2013 settlement focused on “dealer markups.” In a statement, Detroit-based Ally said it “does not engage in or condone violations of law or discriminatory practices, and based on [its] analysis…it does not believe that there is measurable discrimination by auto dealers.”To find minority borrowers, the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Justice Department opted to essentially make educated guesses using an algorithm that assigns probabilities to whether borrowers are minorities based on their last names and locations.They have been sending letters in recent months to Ally customers they believe were overcharged based on the results. One version of the letter, sent to borrowers that the CFPB estimates have at least a 95% probability of being minorities, tells recipients that they qualify for a payment and don’t need to do anything more. It asks borrowers to write back if they aren’t minorities.Another version, sent to borrowers whose likelihood of being a minority under the CFPB algorithm falls between 50% and 95%, asks recipients to sign and return the letter confirming that they are minorities. Recipients have until Saturday to respond to qualify for a payment.The government is expected to start sending out checks, often for hundreds of dollars, later this year or in early 2016.Critics have raised questions about whether the process is fair and precise enough. The consumer bureau, created by the Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul law of 2010, says the process is an effective way to identify victims of discrimination, a priority for the CFPB in its early years.“The CFPB and DOJ have carefully designed a process to reimburse consumers harmed by Ally’s auto-loan pricing policies,” CFPB spokesman Sam Gilford said. To avoid reimbursing ineligible consumers, the government seeks responses to verify whether the recipients of the letters are minorities. “We anticipate that the full amount of the settlement fund will be allocated to affected customers,” Mr. Gilford said.A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment.The payouts for consumers represent the first time the CFPB has used the methodology—known as Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding, or BISG—to reimburse borrowers based on their race or ethnicity.BISG was initially developed for health-care research and has been used by insurance companies to measure racial disparities in health-care outcomes. A key developer of the technique, Rand Corp. statistician  Marc Elliott, has deployed the method in recent years on a wide range of research in which individuals’ last names and locations are known but their actual race or ethnicity isn’t. One project included trying to determine which Medicare beneficiaries should receive survey materials in Spanish and English.But Mr. Elliott warns that some caution is warranted when using the method, originally developed for drawing conclusions about groups, to identify and send checks to individuals. “This is not the primary intended use,” said Mr. Elliott. “That said, depending on the situation, it’s possible that it will be fairly accurate.”;otherFinance;http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-uses-race-test-to-decide-who-to-pay-in-ally-auto-loan-pact-1446111002
188;Bank Indonesia (BI) has acknowledged a new challenge for the national economy – the rise of global small and medium enterprises (SME) and their increased penetration of the local domestic market.According to BI, in order to compete, local SMEs need to be strengthened through massive financing, including through Islamic banking.“The challenge is getting more serious as the economy opens up with developments like the Asean Economic Community (AEC) agreement, which will come into effect soon, leading to massive corporate foreign investments that will bring foreign SMEs to Indonesia,” BI deputy governor Perry Warjiyo said on Wednesday in Surabaya.Perry said that there was a different trend developing in the global business model. Previously, in the 1980s and 1990s, conglomerates dominated global business expansion. But now, he said, SMEs were following conglomerates’ examples and expanding internationally.South Korean and Japanese corporations, Perry explained, often bring along their SMEs to countries where they invest, to supply parts for automotive products, or to support logistics and processes.“This is the growing trend in the global business model, and has become my personal worry. We’re not talking about developing Islamic financial services as they are, but the development of Indonesia’s economy and business environment in general,” he asserted.In respond to that, Perry believes that sharia financing could be a good strategy for developing Indonesian SMEs because it is basically founded on a community based economy, such as Islamic boarding schools and Islamic lecture groups and relies on collective capital from Islamic cooperatives and joint ventures.BI, he further said, have started a pioneer program for developing SMEs through Islamic banking in East Java, particularly Surabaya, as the region is considered the most promising province in Indonesia for Islamic banking.Energi Agro Nusantara’s president director Misbahul Huda said that businesspeople needed to see the added value of the Islamic principles offered by sharia-based financial services, such as better infrastructure and a fairer system than that applied in conventional banking.“In some cases, we find that Islamic banking is like conventional banking in terms of margins. Though, the service is sometimes worse than conventional banking, due to the limited infrastructure,” he said.

189;" stream of major bank scandals has increased interest in “ethical finance,” which could benefit the Islamic banking sector.Supporters argue the growing area of Islamic finance is more ethical because banks and businesses must undergo scrutiny to make sure they're sharia-compliant.“We have a very sweet spot, when conventional banking at the moment is suffering from scandals,” Raja Mohamad, secretary of the Gulf Asia Sharia Compliant Investment Association, said at a conference on Islamic finance in Singapore.'Selling accountability'“We’re not selling Islam here. We’re selling accountability -- transparent, real economic activity.”The religious link is a double-edged sword, though.On the one hand, the public has become more aware of Islamic finance and Islam in general since 9/11, says Habib Ullah, a partner for banking and finance in the Middle East at law firm Taylor Wessing.On the other hand, people might be turned off if they associate Islamic finance with politics.“Another reaction is oops, if you mention Islamic banking, you immediately think of political Islam, possibly terrorism,” said Clement Henry, visiting research professor at National University of Singapore. “You know, it has unfortunate connotations.”Henry said his research, however, has found that people working in the sector tend to be apolitical.Just how do bankers ensure they're respecting sharia law? There’s no set standard.Islamic finance hurdlesThe most common hurdle for Islamic finance is the prohibition for investors to collect interest on loans. So Islamic banks devise alternative structures, such as financing a business or one of its projects, and then sharing in the profit -- or loss.In theory this should improve financial ethics in two ways.First, businesses have to open their books so Islamic banks can verify performance. Without such transparency, businesses could be tempted to downplay profits and give banks a smaller cut.Second, investors are sharing the risk with the companies, as both profit when the venture succeeds. In traditional banking, companies would keep paying interest to lenders even if the venture failed.“You can't make money without actual economic activity, something that you're going to do that creates that justification for profit,” Suhaimi Zainul-Abidin, founding member of the Gulf Asia Sharia Compliant Investments Association, said at the conference.“That’s a really good safeguard for [the] financial industry because you’re not creating money out of thin air, right?"" Zainul-Abidin asked. ""You're not just going to rely on derivatives upon derivatives upon derivatives, right? There's always going to be a real link, and that really, really helps.”Financial productsAs financial products, traditional derivatives are supposed to have a real, underlying economic activity, too.For example, investors buy mortgage-backed securities and enjoy a return based on the payments that homeowners make to their banks.But those and other derivatives are now viewed as the villains of the 2008 financial crisis because they had become so complex that investors often didn't know what the securities contained and how risky they really were.Islamic finance is perceived to have more realistic standards on how businesses can make money.But observers warn that Islamic finance is heading in a dangerous direction, as bankers come up with increasingly complicated financial products.  “Really, most of these products are looking to mirror conventional finance,” Ullah said.";otherFinance;http://www.voanews.com/content/bank-scandals-increase-interest-in-islamic-state-finances/3022987.html

192;"Earlier this week we told you about how “new technology threatens old banking institutions,” at least according to a new marketing survey suggesting that, compared to older Americans, those younger than 34 are far more willing to consider getting their banking needs from sources other than traditional brick-and-mortar banks.One of those non-traditional banking possibilities is peer-to-peer lending. It's not exactly a new phenomenon – in 2011, we gave advice for potential borrowers seeking a would-be loan through peer-to-peer sources – but at some point in the past year or so, it morphed from “the latest Internet niche product” to a major player in the financial landscape. Last year, for example, Google bought a stake in the peer-to-peer Lending Club.What it isWhat is peer-to-peer lending? As the name suggests, it's lending done mostly between individuals (peers) — you borrow money from an individual lender (or a group of individual lenders) as opposed to borrowing from GigantoBankCorp. Or, on the other side, you lend money as an individual investor, rather than as part of GigantoBankCorp.The benefit is that, obviously, you're not dealing with GigantoBankCorp either way, so lenders and borrowers both can enjoy more flexibility than huge and highly regulated financial institutions generally allow.The downside is also that you're not dealing with GigantoBankCorp, which for all its institutional flaws still enjoys benefits like FDIC insurance coverage — and the inertia left over from generations of people raised to associate “banking” with GigantoBankCorp rather than, say, some lender on the Internet.Of course, that inertia might be fading as more people every year become adults whose entire childhoods were spent taking the Internet for granted.Investors becoming interestedRecently, there's been a rise in news reports about peer-to-peer lending – not from a borrower's perspective, but from an investor's. (Overall opinion: investing your money in P2P lending is probably riskier than investing it in old-school banks — but the potential returns are a lot higher, too.)On May 8, for example, the Economist ran a story about the role P2P lending plays, especially in the modern Chinese economy (where American-style banking regulations and property rights are nonexistent, of course): headline “We try harder” and subheading “Without the banks' baggage, shadow banks find it easier to oblige customers.” (That “baggage” includes such obvious things as the cost of building and maintaining actual physical bank branches, as opposed to P2P lending which requires little more than a reliable, secure Internet connections.)On the other hand, traditional-banking advocates say the main reason P2P lending is so popular among investors right now is because interest rates remain unusually low by historical standards. As the Economist noted:bankers often express scepticism about P2P’s staying power. As volumes grow, they say, underwriting standards are bound to fall. Investors will have no real sense of the risks they are running until the next downturn arrives. Moreover, the model’s appeal relies partly on the current low interest rates around the world, which make the extra yield from P2P especially alluring to investors. When rates begin to rise again, that advantage will dissipate.What is the yield from P2P, anyway? Lending Memo.com (obviously promoting a pro-P2P point of view) asked this last September:what return does peer to peer lending even offer?It is this last question that we will devote the focus of our article today, hoping to get an answer by turning to leading voices within the industry. Interestingly, their answers widely vary. Some think a 5% return can be expected; others say 12%.Twelve percent return on a non-loan-shark lending investment sounds too good to be true, or at least too good to be reliably counted upon. Five percent, on the other hand, sounds reasonable, and certainly better than the 1 percent or less interest rate banks give on savings now.However, it was less than a generation ago that four or five percent was a standard, unremarkable interest rate of return for just a regular FDIC-insured savings account; only in this era of unusually low interest rates would any investor seriously consider putting money in a risky investment in hope of a mere five percent return.So those banking advocates mentioned in the Economist, the ones who say P2P's investment advantages will disappear once interest rates return to historically normal levels, might very well be correct.";p2p/p2b;http://www.consumeraffairs.com/
193;"Peer-to-Peer Digital Banks Are Lending Billions of Dollars Trend grows in U.S. and U.K.A recent Fitch Ratings report shows that the peer-to-peer (P2P) digital banking space has become a billion-dollar industry and is growing fast. The largest P2P lenders in the world include Lending Club and Prosper in the U.S. and RateSetter, Zopa and Funding Circle in the U.K. According to Fitch, the largest lenders had a total of $3.5 billion outstanding loans at the end of 2013, up from $1.2 billion a year prior.Lending Club and Prosper control a whopping 98 percent of the U.S. market, The Economist reports, issuing $2.4 million in loans last year. Here's how their services work: Digital brokerages match potential borrowers and lenders online. Theoretically, you can get a loan even if you're an individual or a small business. And as a lender, you can collect a tidy fee. Zopa reportedly pays its lenders 4.9 percent and charges borrowers 5.6 percent for personal loans once their applications are approved.There are no banks involved: no overhead, and no meeting a loan officer. However, there are rumors that some big banks might consider snapping up the entrepreneurial banking platforms or launching their own for small-loan servicing.Marketwatch reports that most P2P loans help people pay off debt and crowd-funded digital banks will have to find new markets to really expand. Where that business will come from exactly is unclear, but there seems to be growing interest.George Abdallah used Funding Circle to open a Papa John's Pizza franchise in Los Angeles. ""They offer entrepreneurs opportunities that might not be there with other lenders,"" he said in a promotional video.

194;"Banking without banks: Bit2Me is building the ‘Uber of finance’The October 2015 Fintech Americas' Hackathon in Miami, sponsored by Visa and Cobiscorp, awarded a grand prize of US$10,000 to Bit2Me, a small startup based in Alicante, Spain, for its new mobile app, Hive.Brave New Coin spoke with Bit2Me founder, CEO and CTO, Leif Ferreira, who explained his vision for Hive, how it works, and how it is very different from his flagship service.While Hive is in the early stages of development, Bit2Me has already proven itself a pioneer in the field of remittances. The service enables users to turn Bitcoin into cash at more than 10,000 legacy banking ATM machines in Spain.In order to allow ATM withdrawals using Bit2Me, Ferreira created a back-end system that connected banks, his website, and the Bitcoin network through a payment gateway, a mobile App, and a chrome extension. The website was launched on January 5, “with some bugs that later were solved,” Ferreira concedes.After a testing period of three weeks, users were able to start sending money to Spain through Bit2Me in February, Ferreira recalled. All that’s needed are bitcoins and a Spanish mobile phone number to send your funds to. Bitcoins are changed into Euros automatically.The recipient receives an SMS message with a PIN, and can go to any ATM that supports Hal-Cash to withdraw the money. The sender will also receive a PIN, to pass on to the recipient. The two pins are needed for withdrawals, and are sent separately to avoid theft and fraud.The company's partner banking networks include many of the major bank chains in Spain, ING Direct, Bankinter, Abanca, EVO Bank, Caja Popular Bank and Targobank.In addition, Bit2Me users can also buy bitcoins at 150 banks in seven countries, Spain, France, Germany, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands and Italy.Ferreira’s new, award winning app, is designed to go far beyond bitcoin access. “Hive and Bit2Me are very different,” Ferreira explained. “I was thinking before about the remittances market (because bit2me is used for this sometimes) but we never started creating a solution. Hive goes further, to the finance market.”“Hive allows users to self-organize as a financial network in a ‘peer to peer’ world, in which financial products such as deposit remittances, loans, and investments are all backed by the Blockchain, undoubtedly the most disruptive financial technology in recent decades. Thus avoiding intermediary companies.”In what he is calling “the Uber of finance,” Hive was conceived to go beyond sending, storing and receiving money, which most bitcoin services allow in some form already. Lending and investing are both major features of the Hive app, via the P2P network.“The people don't need to buy bitcoins. They only buy balance. The bitcoins are invisible for users.”- FerrieraThere are no fees for using the app either, Ferreira confirmed. The only fees users will see are charged individually by the people in the network, such as exchange rate fees or loan interest rates.“In Hive, the ATMs are people, and they do not have to change bitcoins to Euros or other currency. You use these people to add a balance to your account, similar to making a deposit at your bank, and later you can use them for different ways of doing banking with other Hive users. They can: Send money, make payments, purchase investments, do some lending... All this using blockchain technology underneath.”- FerrieraAt first glance, Hive will remind many of 'invisible bitcoin remittance' solution Abra, the overall winner of the prestigious Launch Festival earlier this year. Abra is another smartphone app-based finance service that uses Bitcoin's rails underneath a fiat-denominated service, that is in development.Both Abra and Hive seem to have the same central concept, using people as the ATM machines, and both apps show users on a map display.The similarities end there, however, since Abra appears to be focused only on remittances, while Hive intends to offer a range of banking services.“One user can add funds using his local network of ATMs, and withdraw funds too using this local network. But the users only manage money in these cases. With this balance, they can use it to send a remittance, invest with it, use it for payments, etc.”erreira pointed out that pre-launch information on Abra shows, “their focus is in remittances.” And they are different because, “they only maintain the value of your money for 72 hours.”Nonetheless, both networks seem to be very driven to offer a game-changing remittance service. Research from the World Bank  shows that 2 billion people, or 38 percent of adults in the world, do not have access to basic financial services.A peer to peer remittance and basic banking application could make a huge difference to the unbanked, wherever there is access to smartphones. This is especially true in India and China, the two countries with the largest share of the unbanked.""Universal access to financial services is within reach – thanks to new technologies, transformative business models and ambitious reforms.""While the World Bank data shows that China has a large proportion of the world's unbanked, the country is also home to one of the largest shadow banking economies. People hearing the term “shadow banking” may think that this must be shady business, something bad or unfair, perhaps even criminal. Shadow banking preceded regular banking, and has been part of the financial system in most countries for a long time, and is broadly defined as financial activities outside the regular banking system.The Financial Stability Board’s (FSB) 2014 “Global Shadow Banking Monitoring Report” estimates that global shadow banking assets reached $73 trillion in 2013, 20% more than global GDP. China’s shadow banking assets were almost US$3 trillion at the end of 2013, according to Financial Stability Board estimates.A recent report by the Fung Global Institute, in Hong Kong, estimates shadow banking assets in China at 51% of GDP in 2014, about US$5.2 trillion, up from 43% of GDP in 2012. IMF estimates are slightly higher. Total credit growth in China from 2009 through 2013 was dominated by shadow banking, but this wild growth was brought under control in 2014.Both Hive and Abra seem to have positioned themselves to take advantage of this market. Nevertheless, timing, distribution, and location mean just as much in this kind of race, if not more, so it might all come down to something as arbitrary as which country they chose to target first.“Hive will be launched worldwide when it is ready, but we are planning to market it only in certain countries at that time... We think that the countries we choose are very important. For the moment we can't say the names of the countries,” admitted Ferriera";p2p/p2b;http://bravenewcoin.com/
195;Study: Retail Banks Turn to Fintech to Stay Ahead of StartupsInfosys and Efma find that lenders are aware of new challenges in the industry and are eager to use technology to overcome themThe seventh annual “Innovation in Retail Banking” report compiled by Infosys and Efma has revealed that as much as 84 percent of retail banks across the world have substantially expanded their spending on cutting-edge technology in a bid to stay ahead of emerging competitors.The report was compiled by Infosys Finacle, which is part of EdgeVerve Systems, a subsidiary of Infosys, and Efma – an international non-profit focused on the promotion of tech innovation in the financial services industry.New Competition from Startups a Major ConcernAmong the key highlights of the report, which involved 100 retail banks operating in different parts of the world, is that slightly over two-thirds, or 69 percent, are acutely aware of the new competition coming from startups and are also willing to recognize the beneficial impact of this new competition on tech innovation and the development of the banking industry as a whole.This beneficial impact includes the new business models that are being used by the startups. Peer-to-peer banking, for example, is bringing costs down, a fact that 40 percent of the retail lenders involved in the study consider important.At the same time, however, retail banks are worried that working with startups as partners or competing with them could present a challenge with regard to regulatory compliance as well as security. This is true for 60 percent of the respondents in the study.;p2p/p2b;http://www.financemagnates.com/
196;"Bank to the futureSINGAPORE-There was a time when going to the bank meant gearing up for a long wait - well-used passbook in hand - just to make a deposit, withdraw cash or perform most bankingrelated tasks. Then came the advent of digital channels and an array of financial innovations.As banks seek to strengthen their position in the digital space globally, with their sights trained on harnessing future technologies, the biggest changes - from a consumer's perspective - are mobility and a reduced reliance on physical branches, said Standard Chartered Bank's first group chief innovation officer Anju Patwardhan.""Today, it is all about coming up with applications and processes in making services conveniently available to consumers round the clock, in a fuss-free manner, in a way they want it and on devices of their choice. Banks will have to rapidly evolve accordingly,"" she told TODAY.Just days into her new role at StanChart, Ms Patwardhan - who was previously the bank's group head of Risk Innovation - is all geared up to roll out a string of innovation-led strategies to take the bank to the next level. ""I am focusing on the use of emerging technologies and data science and how we can process this data for actionable insight. After all, data are the new natural resource to be mined with more and more smartphones ... In many parts of the world, I have seen people with more access to smartphones than drinking water or electricity,"" Ms Patwardhan, told TODAY.To build on its digital progress, StanChart is looking at setting up an analytics partnership with A Star for data science projects.""We are going to do a partnership with them to work on very specific data science projects that require a level of expertise that banks usually don't have,"" she said, pointing out that data science is being increasingly used for financial crime and cybercrime analytics and that going ahead, collaborations between banks and security agencies such as Interpol will increase.Meanwhile, according to industry experts, banks are also increasingly embedding innovation hubs within their systems to brace for the new crop of Fintech companies such as Bitcoins and other crypto-currencies that have caught banks off-guard, leaving their traditional business model disrupted.""We are analysing what Bitcoins and crypto-currencies mean for us. We are watching the space, but what looks important to us is the underlying blockchain technology. We engaged in discussions with Infocomm Development Authority (IDA) of Singapore and quickly zeroed in on using this technology in trade finance - an area of common interest for the Republic and us as a bank. This is also different from what others are doing with blockchain technology,"" she said referring to several companies using it in financial services space including settlements, derivatives and foreignexchange.Rapidly eating into the banking sector's domain too are also newer financial services such as social and peer-to-peer (P2P) payments and crowdfunding. According to a Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research report, banks in the United States earned about US$150 billion (S$203 billion) last year. They estimate that about US$11 billion, or 7 per cent of annual profit, could be at risk from non-bank disintermediation such as P2P and other shadow banking companies over the next five years.""The biggest business model innovation in banking to my mind is P2P lending,"" she added. ""Though it hasn't really reached Asia in a big way, it is relatively big in China. We are actively monitoring it ... It is interesting to note the increasing number of competitive collaboration between banks and P2P companies,"" she noted.MORE THAN 25 YEARS OF EXPERIENCEMs Patwardhan, previously StanChart's group head of risk innovation, was appointed as the bank's first group chief innovation officer, effective from July 1. She has more than 25 years of experience in the financial services industry, including an 18-year stint at Citibank.Ms Patwardhan says that today, it is all about coming up with applications and processes in making services conveniently available to consumers round the clock.";p2p/p2b;Today articolo 4/7/2015
197;Rumor Mill: Samsung Pay To Add P2P PaymentsSamsung may use its Samsung Pay mobile payments service to launch the next generation of P2P payments.Phone-to-phone payments, that is.A Business Korea article recently reported that the company is working on implementing a technology that enables payments to be exchanged between smartphones using NFC chips. Because Samsung Pay uses NCF and magnetic secure transmission (MST) technology to enable its payment transfers, having the ability to pay a person via the devices seems to be the next logical step.While mobile payment apps such as Samsung Pay have been traditionally thought of for making payments in-app, online and in store, the next wave of Samsung Pay technology may provide its users and potential users with another value add to their mobile payments option.According to the Business Korea article, Hankook NFC, a mobile payment startup, has applied for a patent to enable technology to work with Samsung Pay and NFC. That partnership would possibly be used to develop the technology that allows consumers to use Samsung Pay to transfer money between devices.“If Samsung Electronics expands the application of the NFC payment module, smartphones with Samsung Pay can be used as mobile payment devices. Accordingly, it is possible to not only transfer money between smartphones but also pay with credit cards,” said an unnamed source from a FinTech company.For Samsung Pay, what sets it apart in the crowded mobile payments space is its MST technology, which enables Samsung Pay acceptance at just about every terminal that today accepts any mag stripe or EMV card without merchants having to change anything at their points of sale to accept payments made using it.Samsung Pay works on Galaxy S6, S6 edge, Note5 and S6 edge+ devices operating on the AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint and U.S. Cellular networks in the United States.;p2p/p2b;http://www.pymnts.com/news/2015/rumor-mill-samsung-pay-to-add-p2p-payments/
198;Billon Adds Its Own Twist To P2P Tip PaymentsPolish FinTech company Billon is rolling the dice with a new P2P payments network aimed at the online gaming community.The payments startup is powering a new payment feature for the users of the popular video streaming and gaming network Twitch, enabling them to send micropayments through a seamless payment system essentially tipping content creators, reports TechCrunch.The gaming network, which was acquired by Amazon in 2014 for $970 million, is home to an active and engaged network of gaming enthusiasts. The network allows players to broadcast live gameplay and upload videos to the network of over 55 million users.To gather “tips” through the payments network, Twitch users must add a button to their user public profile and add funds to their accounts using various methods. Once the funds have been credited to their account, they simply select the friends they’d like to “tip” and send their payment through the Twitch interface. Recipients can cash out in multiple ways, including cash, prepaid cards, vouchers and checks.Billon’s founders have been working on the network infrastructure, which they sometimes refer to as “the Skype of payments,” since 2012. Their goal was to allow global customers to send secure and costless payments to one another in the currency of their choice.“Billion has created the world’s first blockchain-enabling government currency transactions that is compliant with regulations,” Cofounder Andrzej Horoszczak told TechCrunch. “This is important. Mass adoption can only occur if clients are using their existing mobile phones and favorite local currency. Today, payments are a broken end-to-end value chain full of intermediaries, payment insurers, liquidity providers, clearing agents, settlement agents and accountholders. Imagine giving the power to truly provide an end-to-end solution … and eliminate all the cost, risk and hassle that exists today.”Per the TechCrunch story, Billon currently has a group of 1,300 users in a soft launch on Twitch with all transactions falling into the sub-$10 electronic transaction category. This small transaction market holds huge potential as people look for easy ways to send small amounts of money digitally without the hassle of banking fees.Twitch is only the first implementation of the software, and Billion will begin rolling out additional partnerships this month.;p2p/p2b;http://www.pymnts.com/news/2015/u-s-bank-adds-mobile-payments-for-pilots/

They are often the payment types of choice to settle transactions between individuals. The proliferation of Internet-connected devices and simple applications makes it possible for an individual to transfer funds to another individual or microbusiness using only the recipient's email address or cell phone number via person-to-person (P2P) payment. Unlike other new payment types or payment form factors, P2P can achieve scale rapidly because all the necessary market components are in place, including motivated consumers, existing infrastructure, and low to no-cost price points to encourage adoption. Mercator Advisory Group's latest research report, The Opportunity of Person to Person Payments, explores the existing products and product providers in the P2P marketplace, describes how they operate, and estimates the current and addressable market size.""Third-party fintech companies are receiving most of the industry attention right now when it comes to P2P solutions.

200;North American consumers slow to adopt mobile phone payments: Accenture surveyWhile more than half of North American consumers are aware they can make payments through their mobile phones, fewer than one in five (18%) use these phones to make at least one payment a week, according to a report released on Tuesday by Accenture, a global management consulting, technology services and outsourcing company.Apple Pay – just one year after launching – is used for more than two-thirds (68%) of all mobile payments in U.S. stores, the survey found The report, titled 2015 North America Consumer Digital Payments Survey was based on a survey of 4,000 smartphone users in Canada and the United States. It found that while the number of North American consumers who know they can use their phones as a payment device jumped nearly 10 percentage points since last year, to 52%, actual mobile-payment usage remained flat, growing only 1%.“Though it’s clear that consumers are aware that they can make payments through their phones, continued use of existing payment methods – such as credit cards and cash – and slow retail adoption of modern card readers have caused usage levels to remain stagnant over the last year,” said Robert Flynn, managing director for Accenture Payment Services in North America, in a press release. “This is a clear indicator to banks and retailers that although the digital transformation in payments is progressing, there is still a long way to go before we reach broad market adoption.”The Accenture survey identified two groups of early adopters driving mobile-payments usage: high-income consumers and Millennials. Consumers with household income of at least $150,000 are the most-avid adopters, with 38% using their phones to make payments at merchant locations at least weekly, the release said. Twenty-three percent of Millennials – people between the ages of 18 and 34 – reported using their phones to make mobile payments at a merchant location at least weekly compared to an average of 18% for other age groups.The survey also identified ways to increase mobile-payment adoption rates – namely, by giving consumers better security, incentives and rewards. More than three-quarters of consumers who currently make mobile payments said they would increase their usage if offered discount pricing or coupons based on past buying behavior (cited by 79% of users) and if they received reward points (cited by 78%). Additionally, more than half of those not currently making mobile payments would make them if offered discount pricing or coupons (cited by 54% of non-users) or reward points (53%).When looking at which mobile payment ecosystems are gaining the most momentum, the study found that Apple Pay – just one year after launching – is used for more than two-thirds (68%) of all mobile payments in U.S. stores.In terms of emerging trends, the survey found continued consumer interest in connected commerce (wearable or connected payment devices) and peer-to-peer (P2P) payments. Even though the payments industry has not yet scratched the surface on the “art of the possible” in connected commerce, one in five consumers (20%) said they have used a wearable device to make a payment at least once, and the same number of respondents reported being interested in making a payment through a connected smart device such as a smart appliance or a smart car.The survey also pointed to a high level of adoption for P2P payments, as well as room for continued growth. More than two out of every five consumers surveyed (42%) reported they have used P2P payment apps, and 15 percent said they make P2P payments weekly, the release said.“We’re at the edge of a new frontier for connected commerce and just beginning to see some of the possibilities it offers,” said David Edmondson, senior managing director of Accenture’s Banking industry practice for North America, in the release. “With almost half of North Americans still using traditional cheques to make payments to other consumers, P2P payments remains poised for potentially strong growth. Overall, integrating payments with the power that Internet-of-Things technologies can offer promises to usher in a new era of consumer product innovation and retail merchandising.”;p2p/p2b;http://www.canadianunderwriter.ca/news/north-american-consumers-slow-to-adopt-mobile-phone-payments-accenture-survey/1003855631/?&er=NA
201;Mobile payment taking hold in SEARevenue prospects for cellcos, banks, credit card networks, and financial technology startups in Southeast Asia are looking up due to an anticipated surge in mobile payments adoption over the next five years.Driving this growth, according to research firm Forrester, is the surge of smartphone penetration in the region, which it forecasts to grow to 230 million units by 2017 from 175 million this year.A report released by Forrester recently showed that remittances will continue to spur peer-to-peer (P2P) payment growth in emerging markets, which is setting the stage for digital wallets. Migrant workers are also increasingly turning to telcos and fintech startups such as Xoom, Remitly, TransferTo, TransferWise, and MatchMove to remit money via their mobile phones.Meanwhile, cross-border m-commerce is also driving growth in remote payments as many online consumers are shopping on their mobile devices in countries like Singapore and Malaysia. Cross-border orders using credit cards and PayPal are significant.Forrester observed that more players are incorporating features such as coupons and loyalty rewards into their mobile payment systems, which somewhat resemble digital wallets but do not qualify as such — yet.“Banks looking to get in on the mobile payment opportunity must decide if they want to build their own mobile payment systems or partner with business/technology vendors. Having a clearly defined mobile payment strategy will protect and deepen the bank’s relationships with both retail and business customers,” the report noted.;p2p/p2b;http://www.telecomasia.net/content/mobile-payment-taking-hold-sea
202;Why PayPal launched a new mobile peer-to-peer payment platformPayPal announced a new mobile peer-to-peer (P2P) payment platform called PayPal.me, which will allow users to create a personalized PayPal link and send it to peers for fast P2P transfers through PayPal. Once the link is created, the user sends it to the individual or group as a request for funds. After the link is received, the value of the transaction is entered and the funds are transferred to the original user's PayPal account. The service will allow links to be sent through multiple platforms – instant message, social media, e-mail, and more – and will work on both desktop and mobile.The results of PayPal's newest Money Habits Study substantiate the use case for the new service. The survey findings indicate that small debts between peers add up fast in both amount and in impact, and paying them back is challenging and problematic:•Most adults don’t like to ask people to pay them back. On average, individuals are owed $450 at any given time, and over one-third have lost a friend over an IOU.•Individuals are looking for more flexible and convenient ways to manage money. 75% of users surveyed feel “relieved” at the prospect of using digital P2P to settle small debts. The same amount don’t like to deal with checks. Conversion rates go down when consumers have to re-enter long credit card numbers or security codes on small screens – a step that PayPal.me avoids.•It’s not just millennials who want a digital tool to manage money. 35% of Generation X-ers and 23% of young Baby Boomers would prefer to pay small amounts with their phone than with their wallet. As a point of reference, our own forecast has mobile P2P payments growing from $5.6 billion in 2014 to $174 billion in 2019.Finding this article interesting?

203;Western Union Rolls Out X-Border Social P2PWestern Union is making money transfers a little more social.Yesterday (Oct. 26), the company launched WU Connect, a technology platform that integrates with consumer messaging and social media platforms to enable users to quickly and conveniently transfer money throughout the world.Embedding Western Union’s existing global money transfer capability into third-party platforms, WU Connect allows the sender to transmit funds from a debit card, credit card or a bank account — via those platforms — to a recipient.“At Western Union, we are actively listening to the voice of consumers and using that feedback as the basis for innovation in all of cross-border money transfer and payment capabilities,” Western Union President and CEO Hikmet Ersek stated in a press release. “We are continuing to build upon our core strengths, expanding our digital business, investing in technology and compliance capabilities to connect the digital and physical worlds.”Also commenting in the release was David Thompson, EVP, Global Operations and Technology and CTO at Western Union, who remarked of WU Connect: “This puts Western Union in a position to extend its digital platform to networks whose users are looking for more convenient ways to send and receive money globally on a platform of their choice.”Though no specific social or messaging platforms are cited in the release, it is expressed that Western Union plans to enter into conversations with related companies about the integration of WU Connect.Presently, the WU Connect platform offers a suite of application programming interfaces (APIs) built on a scalable infrastructure for the purposes of enabling deployment of domestic and cross-border remittance capabilities.;p2p/p2b;http://www.pymnts.com/news/social-commerce/2015/western-union-rolls-out-x-border-payments/
204;"Everything You Need to Know About PayPal, Square Cash and VenmoMy sister and I keep a running tab with each other. She sent a bouquet of flowers for our cousin’s high school graduation; I owe her. I bought our Dad a dual-blade hedge trimmer for Father’s Day; she owes me. She got another cousin the wedding gift that we agreed to split; I owe her. You get the idea.Neither of us is too concerned about the balance; we know we’re good for the money. But when I sent my sister a text inviting her to use the peer-to-peer payment app Square Cash so we could pay each other without sending checks, her response was, “Do you need me to do this?” She wasn’t thrilled about downloading yet another app, learning how to use yet another service and creating an account with yet another company.cash-01-8c11fa134db76e638189fc64b1a640f6The Square Cash app in useGiven my job as a tech reviewer, I often hit up my relatives and close friends for testing help. It’s understandable that they have symptoms of download fatigue.Yet, when I polled a broader group, most of the people I talked to weren’t using peer-to-peer payment apps, even if they had heard of them. Whether it’s app overload or nervousness about digital transactions, P2P payments have a way to go before they catch on with a majority of my friends and family. Forrester Research, however, is hopeful: In a study published last fall, it updated its U.S. forecast for mobile P2P payments from $4 billion by 2017 to $5 billion in 2014.This week, I dived into three P2P payment apps — PayPal, Square Cash and Venmo (acquired by PayPal in December 2013). Facebook also joined the fray in March, enabling fee-free P2P payments via debit card between friends in Facebook Messenger, but the feature is still rolling out and hasn’t been added in my app. My hope is that this guide will make you at least a little more comfortable with digital payments — even helping you pay your sister back on time.The basicsAll three of these apps work on iOS and Android, as well as via Web browsers. Square Cash originally launched using a system that involved sending an email to someone with the dollar amount in the subject line and “Cash@square.com” copied in the message, but the majority of people now use the Square Cash app, which doesn’t involve email. None of these apps requires NFC (near field communication) technology in your phone; all you need is a connection to the Internet. It took me just a few minutes to set up each app, entering details like my debit card number, ZIP code, full name and phone number for verification.Privacy and securityAll three of these apps want you to feel as secure as possible so you won’t hesitate to use them (and so they’re not on the hook for fraud). On iOS, they can each verify your identity with Apple’s Touch ID, the iPhone’s built-in fingerprint tool, every time you use them, giving you an extra layer of in-app security.Venmo requires multifactor authentication if you sign up for the service on one device and then try to use it on another. PayPal confirms your identity using various security questions, and all three apps can send authentication codes to your mobile device to make sure you are who you say you are. You can also set up Square Cash so that every transaction requires you to enter the three-digit secure code on the back of your debit card.Cut out middlemen using direct depositsOne of my favorite features of Square Cash is that the money you send or receive comes and goes directly from or to a bank account linked to your debit card. Most payments deposit instantly, according to Square, but some take one to two business days, depending on the bank. For example, a payment my husband sent to me on a Saturday night showed up in my bank account on Monday. But having money sent direct to your account is a big differentiator between Square Cash and PayPal and Venmo, which keep money sent to you in your account as a balance. From there, you have to take the extra step of transferring the money to your bank account.Some people see an upside to keeping a balance in their account. PayPal points out that you can use this balance to pay businesses that accept PayPal, and its app has a cool feature that shows you nearby merchants that accept PayPal.If you’re trying to pay someone or get paid using a P2P app, it helps if that app is popular enough to be used by a lot of your friends. PayPal’s app has 165 million active users globally; Square Cash and Venmo won’t say how many users they have, and are limited to the U.S.If you don’t mind sharing your financial transactions with the world, go for Venmo. If you sign up for Venmo using your Facebook account or connect your Facebook account to Venmo, whenever you send or receive a payment, the rest of the Venmo community sees this transaction. This Public setting is the default, though settings can be changed to share only with your friends or only with the people in the transaction.Some people who really like adding a social element to their otherwise-dull financial transactions might be put off by Venmo’s limited social network ties, preferring other networks like Twitter or Instagram over Facebook.Do any of these payments involve fees?Square Cash transactions are free, but only work with debit cards — not with credit cards or bank accounts. Free transactions are limited to $2,500 a week. Square Cash Pro, which is aimed at small businesses, has no dollar amount limit, but charges 1.5 percent for debit card or bank account transactions. So if you’re paying a friend using Square Cash, it won’t cost you anything, but if you pay for your hairdresser who accepts Square Cash Pro, he or she will incur the 1.5 percent fee.PayPal transactions that are made directly to or from your bank account or PayPal balance are free, but if you make a payment to a friend using your debit or credit card, you’ll have to pay a 2.9 percent transaction fee. PayPal has no limits to the amount of money exchanged per week.Venmo is a fee-free app if you use your Venmo balance, bank account or debit card for P2P payments, but when you pay with a credit card you’ll get slapped with a 3 percent fee. Venmo limits users’ weekly spending to $299.99, but people can increase this to $2,999.99 by verifying their identity. This is done by either adding one’s Facebook account to the Venmo account or adding one’s ZIP code, last four digits of one’s social security number and birthdate.PayPal’s longstanding clout gives it extra long reach: It lets people make P2P payments across borders, sending money in 25 currencies. Neither Venmo nor Square Cash lets you do this.Hiding your identityMaybe you’d rather not give your full name to the guy who buys your couch. For that, Square Cash has $Cashtags, or handles you can create to disguise your full identity. For example, I could go by “$KateTheGreat345” if I wanted to be a bit more anonymous. PayPal and Venmo don’t yet offer options like this.As more and more people find it impossible to go anywhere without their smartphones, mobile payments stand a better chance of becoming the simplest cash alternative. Just make sure you know how to pay, and how much you can exchange to avoid pesky fees.";p2p/p2b;http://recode.net/2015/06/24/everything-you-need-to-know-about-paypal-square-cash-and-venmo/
205;Sweden Establishes Commitment to Go Cashless, Looks to Digital PaymentsSweden is making great strides in the cashless society movement.In 2011 the country launched Swish, a payments app that allows citizens to make P2P transactions in real-time.Since then, numerous local businesses have adopted the seamless practice. Fast forward to today, digital payments are now the preferred method of transaction for most residents.“Cash is still an important means of payment in many countries’ markets, but that no longer applies here in Sweden. Our use of cash is small, and it’s decreasing rapidly,” said Niklas Arvidsson, an industrial technology and management researcher at Stockholm’s KTH Royal Institute of Technology.Arvidsson predicts that cash will be completely phased out of Sweden in 15 years. A handful of banks in the area have already started to close down ATMs. Furthermore, individuals who use large amounts of bank notes are being flagged by local law enforcement groups.To help children adopt the nascent technology, parents are issuing prepaid cards to their little ones for weekly allowances. Even churches are supporting cashless practices by accepting donations digitally.Some residents are of the view that Swish is safer than carrying around hard money. Buses have turned to virtual payments after several drivers were robbed. This is also the same reason why the technology is spreading like wildfire in Africa. Individuals in the region use finance apps to manage their daily expenses and monthly bills.While Sweden moves into the modern cashless era, many countries are still struggling to shift toward new payment systems. “Swish is a brilliant idea, but to introduce it internationally is a challenge, not least because it takes a long time to change other countries’ banking systems from scratch. But it is not impossible that a Swish-based banking revolution can also occur abroad,” highlighted Arvidsson.;p2p/p2b;http://paymentweek.com/2015-11-4-sweden-establishes-commitment-to-go-cashless-looks-to-digital-payments-8756/

They also reduce the hassle of going to a money transfer agency, remembering a checkbook, or finding an ATM.The opportunity is huge. Globally, the market for peer-to-peer transfers and remittances is worth well over $1 trillion.In a recent report from BI Intelligence, we profile 10 of the most exciting P2P payment apps and explain how they may serve as a bridge to wider use of smartphones to complete in-person ""walletless transactions,"" at stores and restaurants. Present use cases include money transfers between friends and family, international remittances, and even fees and wages paid to independent workers.Access the Full Report By Signing Up For A Trial Today >>Here are some of the key takeaways from the report: •Large tech companies and startups are getting involved in P2P (threatening legacy financial institutions). Google Wallet is already a player in this space, and Facebook seems to be moving closer to offering a service. The P2P market is larger than many people imagine.• Globally, the volume of P2P payments is over $1 trillion and only a sliver of those transactions — just $5 billion in the U.S., for example — are currently conducted via mobile phones.• Peer-to-peer payment apps solve real pain points for consumers. Our high-end estimate is that mobile P2P transactions volume could reach $86 billion in the U.S. by 2018. • In emerging markets, there is especially huge potential for P2P payments made on cell phones, due to a lack of financial infrastructure. A high proportion of the population in these markets lack access to checking and savings accounts.•Kenyan telecom Safaricom provides an excellent case study for the success of mobile P2P payments in emerging technology markets. The telecom has a product called M-Pesa, which allows its users to transfer  money to one another via text message. Largely as a result of M-Pesa's success, an impressive 92% of Kenyans say they have used mobile P2P payments.  •Mobile P2P payment services are usually free or next to free to use, which begs the question of how they will be monetized. Different services have experimented with fees and even advertising. But mainly, these services will serve as Trojan horses to gain user trust for mobile-based transactions in general.  In full, the report: •Forecasts transaction volume for mobile P2P payments through 2018 and gives an estimate for the size of global P2P payments.•Analyzes the major obstacles that mobile P2P payments face, including interoperability and especially consumer security fears. •Explains the value of mobile P2P payments to consumers and why there is such a compelling case for mass adoption. •Digs into ten companies' P2P services and explains some of their idiosyncrasies and what they say about where the payments industry is heading.•Discusses the innovations that have helped the above companies succeed.To access the full report from BI Intelligence, sign up for a 14-day trial here.

207;"New P2P Payments Patent Shows Apple Could Be Looking To Kill Off PayPal And Venmoventures into new territory with its latest move to patent a Wallet App person-to-person (P2P) payment feature that will let iPhone users transmit money to each other directly.This added feature would cut out the middleman and make PayPal and Venmo obsolete, potentially seriously harming both companies.According to Patently Apple, ""Apple's invention generally relates to wireless communications, wireless electronic devices and more specifically to techniques for conducting financial transactions by communicating encrypted financial credentials between the wireless electronic devices.""The way the proposed app works is fairly straightforward. After opening the Wallet app the user chooses one of their credit cards linked to it, types in the amount, chooses the iPhone user recipient and finally authenticates the transaction via fingerprint or the iPhone's passcode. An encrypted payment package is then sent to the receiving iPhone user. There is nothing particularly cutting-edge about the technical side of the process. The potential economic implications of this proposed added feature, however, are huge, especially for PayPal and Venmo who hold much of the market share in the mobile payment sector so far.This market is all about innovation and user- riendliness. Traditional banks, being too risk-averse and slow-moving have been losing out already. Potentially PayPal and Venmo could be next, if overtaken by a more convenient, extra-safe and cheaper Apple P2P system.Adding P2P payments would take Apple one step closer to turning into a future veritable one-stop bank for its users, a concept that is at least conceivable.    The market for P2P transmission is enormous and swiftly expanding. It is therefore not surprising that Apple wants a share of it. The first move has been made now with the patent application for Apple's very own P2P Payment system. Whether Apple will actually implement its new technology in the near future remains to be seen, as it could also simply be a means of stopping a competitor from using this same type of feature. At some point though, Apple is bound to take this step, much to the detriment of PayPal and Venmo.

208;"UAE banks embrace cutting-edge technology to offer new mobile solutionsTech-savvy UAE is aggressively adapting smart solutions in all segments of the economy, and with the banking sector being the backbone of the country, it is inevitable that the wave will engulf change faster than one can even think of.Close on the heels of the 35th Gitex Technology Week, bankers in the region deliberated on various issues that are at the threshold of throwing challenges open and bringing out the best to enhance the experience of both bankers and consumers, with one challenged to provide the best and the other demanding it.According to Marmore's UAE Banking Report, the government has taken initiatives to digitise the UAE's banking and financial sector under its smart government programme, to offer digital solutions, enhance financial inclusion and minimise transaction costs for consumers. In recent years, consumers, especially those in the younger generation, have shown a preference to meet their banking needs remotely through the Internet.The UAE Banks Federation, a standards body representing 50 banks in the country, has cleared its mobile wallet project for launch, pending final approval from the Central Bank of the UAE. The project is part of the UAE's smart government initiative and will enable banks to offer peer-to-peer (P2P) and NFC mobile payments, as well as loyalty programmes to customers.IDC recently estimated that IT spending in the Middle East and Africa in 2015 will surpass $270 billion. UAE banks are looking to get ahead of the technological change happening in the sector.Commercial Bank of Dubai launched the first personal finance management platform, followed by a Facebook arm, to offer a virtual banking experience. Along the same lines, Mashreq's eCube digital branches and iMashreq self-service branch now include the option to use remote video banking. Mashreq also pioneered its EMV (Europay, MasterCard and Visa)-compliant mobile point-of-sale (POS) solution Payport, and took NFC contactless payments mainstream with its TAP n GO stickers.In the remittance and payments space, Emirates NBD launched P2P payments to its customers via MePAY, while RakBank launched ATM card-less cash withdrawals. Most recently, Beehive, the UAE's first online marketplace for P2P lending was launched. The introduction of the Al Etihad Credit Bureau increased smartphone penetration amongst the population, and the potential disruption of non-banks are the key ingredients that will drive further change.At present, the UAE accounts for $230 billion in consumer payments to 170 government entities and more than 350,000 merchants annually, 75 per cent of which are cash transactions. UAE consumers, businesses, merchants, banks, forex companies and even government service providers will be handling far less cash by 2020, according to Triple, a UAE-based digital payments service company.M.R. Raghu, senior vice-president for research at Markaz, said: ""Globally, the usage of cash lessened as plastic cards became more popular. With the introduction of mobile wallets and other mobile-based payment platforms, cash may be affected by the usage of [both debit and credit] cards.""""Innovations in payment systems is only a means by which cash gets transferred to consumers, borrowers and other parties, and banks will still have to play the role of the intermediary connecting various parties. As long as the banks are able to keep up with the changes happening in the sector, and use technology efficiently to reduce costs and improve services they will be able to attract business across verticals.""The UAE is fast emerging as one of the most competitive and fastest-growing markets for cashless payments in the region, with over 12 million cards catering to a bankable population of 3.5 to four million, according to Lafferty Research 2014. The country boasts of a vibrant and tech-savvy populace with high broadband and smartphone penetration levels, and alternative payment mechanisms such as mobile wallets and direct debit platforms are becoming increasingly popular.E- and m-commerce, NFC payments and innovations such as mobile POS will drive cashless transactions, and bring hitherto untapped segments like home delivery into the payments domain. UAE banks are moving quickly to upgrade payment technologies, spending huge sums to improve their technology infrastructure, with special focus on security.""Banking has moved from the traditional relationship based to technology-based service, and user experience is now as important as a dedicated relationship manager in how the bank's customer service is perceived,"" added Raghu,""""Developing mobile phone compatible solutions and ensuring ease of service is required if banks hope to capture millennial and an increasingly tech-savvy expat clients. Banks are far more likely to succeed in selling their products and increasing cross-sell if they adopt more transparency in their product descriptions, rates and charges.""Ehsaan Ahmed, head of GTS and corporate strategy at Noor Bank, said: ""Mobile wallet is emerging as an alternative mechanism to payments. Banks need to continuously invest in developing capability to offer new payment solutions. Relying on traditional expertise of handling payments as cash, cheques or through credit or debit cards, is not sufficient for banks looking to excel in delivering value add to their customers. Banks that are innovative are engaging with specialist partners to ensure they have a value added and competitive solution to take to their clients.""";p2p/p2b;http://www.albawaba.com/business/uae-banks-embrace-mobile-solutions-759170
209;"Facebook Users In The U.S. Can Now Send P2P Payments Via MessengerFacebook is rolling out its person-to-person payments service via Messenger to all users in the United States. Beginning Tuesday, anyone with a Messenger account, even without a Facebook account, can send money to friends and family straight from their bank accounts.Former head of PayPal now Facebook Vice President of Messaging David Marcus announced the new feature, which he describes as ""easy and safe"" on his Facebook page.""We're happy to announce that Messenger person-to-person payments are now available to everyone in the U.S.!"" Marcus says. ""Add your Debit Card and pay anyone on Messenger in a few taps. Money goes straight from your checking account to the recipient's checking account.""Users who want to use the service will be prompted to link their Visa or MasterCard debit card before they can send money. Facebook says it has decided against making the new service compatible with credit cards to reduce fraud and do away with exorbitant fees that might turn off users from using the service. Venmo, for instance, is a P2P payments service that allows credit cards but charges a 3 percent fee for every credit card transaction.To send payments, users simply tap on the dollar icon below a conversation and type in the amount they wish to send. They can then tap on Pay on the upper corner of the screen to complete the transaction. A status message will show up below the transaction to tell the user if the payment has been sent. Recipients simply have to accept the payment when they open Messenger and wait for the money to appear in their bank account usually after three days.Security is a big deal for any sort of electronic payments service, and Facebook says the new service is contained in a secure, encrypted environment constantly monitored and controlled by an independent group of anti-fraud experts.    Facebook first unveiled its new P2P payments service integrated into Messenger in March, at first making it available only to a select group of users. The service began expanding to metropolitan New York in May before Facebook finally released it to the entire U.S. market.The electronics payments service is expected to triple in volume from $52 billion in 2014 to $142 billion in five years, says Forrester Research, so it isn't surprising the Facebook is taking a big step toward this directionp2";p2p/p2b;http://www.techtimes.com/articles/65162/20150701/facebook-users-in-the-u-s-can-now-send-p2p-payments-via-messenger.htm
210;Apple’s P2P payment patent has a focus on securityIn a few years, “Sorry, I don’t have any cash on me” may no longer be a good enough excuse to give that chronically money-strapped friend when they come around asking to borrow a few bucks.That’s because a newly released Apple patent suggests that the iPhone maker may be getting into the person-to-person payment game in future versions of its hardware.The application describes a method of transferring money between two users, and what really stands out is how often mentions of security arise. Forms of the word “encrypt” appear 157 times throughout the document, while “secure” and “security” have a combined 216 instances. It also mentions “biometric” sensors like the iPhone’s Touch ID and expands this to include retinal scanners and palm sensors because why not?This language is not necessarily a reflection of Apple’s staunch public stance on user privacy, however. Any technology that uses personal and financial information had better keep its encryption game strong both because it’s better for customers and because people are really paying attention to that stuff these days.Apple Pay, the company’s current touchless payment method, also uses Touch ID to authorize payments on the latest iPhone models, the 6 and 6 Plus. This patent doesn’t guarantee anything, but if Apple goes ahead with integrating person-to-person payments in future hardware like the upcoming iPhone 6s, it would be pulling a move similar to its recently released Apple Music streaming platform by trying to replace features of third-party apps with its own native solutions.Snapchat and Facebook already include options to let users send money back and forth. Apple’s entry into this space would continue its quest to replace your wallet with its own onboard Passbook utility (which will be reborn as Wallet when iOS 9 launches this fall).;p2p/p2b;http://www.cultofmac.com/328077/apples-p2p-payment-patent-has-a-focus-on-security/

212;"P2P Payments App Xendit Launches In IndonesiaXendit, a money-transfer service geared toward Southeast Asian countries, is launching today in Indonesia.The company is billing itself as a more private money-transfer service that’ll beat companies like Venmo to the market in Southeast Asia. Users can transfer money within private groups, as well as chat, but it’s not about making those transactions public, co-founder Moses Lo said. Since starting the beta a few months ago, the company has 13,000 people using the service.Users load money onto Xendit and they can send and request money from friends in the service or through phone numbers. The company not only has to work with Indonesian banks, but also ATM networks, Lo said. The company is part of this year’s summer Y Combinator batch. The incubator is the only institutional investor in the company.Send Money 3 xendit“In Southeast Asia, it’s the perfect storm,” Lo said. “One is a huge population with technology, two is nascent financial services, and third is it’s one of the most viral regions. In Indonesia, there’s [greater than 100 percent] penetration for phones. These people don’t have a bank account, penetration credit card is 3 percent, but there’s a huge population with technology.”Given the similarities to a service like Venmo, There’s plenty of competition, to be sure. There’s a huge list of other money-transfer service startups. Services like WeChat could throw their resources behind a competing product. Telecom companies may get their act together and build a competitor that could easily overtake a company like Xendit. And new financial services startups are constantly popping up that could also beat out Xendit through a combination of moving faster or building a better service.There’s the looming giant PayPal, though Venmo and PayPal do not offer peer-to-peer payments in Indonesia yet. With respect to Venmo, a PayPal representative said the company did not have anything to share around global expansion at this time. And then there’s the cash economy, one of the company’s largest competing forces, Lo said. “We have to convince people in a cash culture that we’re more seamless,” he said. “Through the market share, cash is still the biggest, and we need to change that.”Xendit holds money on behalf of the user, and then works with banks to wire money. “It’s a normal banking relationship,” Lo said, but in the future the company wants to have deeper integrations and core banking services. “For now we’re doing payments pretty normally; we’re just doing it in an automated, fast, seamless fashion.”Many sales in Southeast Asia happen through services like WhatsApp. For example, a merchant may sell something by posting an image to Instagram, which will then turn into a WhatsApp conversation, which then turns into a transfer of money for the purchase, Lo said. Xendit, he said, is geared toward making that more seamless.“Indonesia is so big, that’s where [we figured] we’d start and want to win.” Lo said. “The vision is Southeast Asia, the Philippines, Thailand, those with similar profiles among other Asiatic countries.”";p2p/p2b;http://techcrunch.com/2015/08/17/p2p-payments-app-xendit-launches-in-indonesia/
213;MasterCard now allows any business to enable P2P paymentsPayments giant MasterCard is the latest company to get into the person-to-person payments business, joining Facebook, PayPal, and rival Visa. The company launched MasterCard Send, a service that allows people to link their debit card accounts online or on a phone and transfer money to anyone in the U.S. using their MasterCard send account. Electronic peer-to-peer payments aim to replace paying people with cash or check. The biggest difference with MasterCard Send and other competitors is that it is not a direct-to-consumer service. This isn’t a consumer offering but rather a way for businesses to reimburse their customers, or offer rebates without having to send a check in the mail. Berkshire Hathaway Travel Protection and FreeShipping.com are among two of the first businesses who have integrated MasterCard Send to transfer money. Shopping site FreeShipping.com, which offers members cash back on purchases they make on the site, is using MasterCard’s technology to deliver cash-back payouts to users’ debit card accounts. Travel insurance company Berkshire Hathaway Travel Protection will be using MasterCard Send to disburse user claimsUsing MasterCard Send, a consumer adds a debit account online, including MasterCard and non-MasterCard debit cards, and can send cash to anyone in the U.S. with a debit account (the recipient will have to enter their debit card account to deposit the money). MasterCard says transfers can take place the same-day they are sent. MasterCard is trying to ride the wave of growth in peer-to-peer payments, which Forrester Research expects to grow to $17 billion by 2019, from $5.2 billion in 2014. But MasterCard is late to the game, and other early movers have already gained market share. Forrester notes that currently seventy-three percent of American adults who use the Internet and make P2P payments use PayPal. But it’s important to note that consumers don’t want to be subject to the fees associated with these transactions, which are not a factor when paying with cash or check.MasterCard says that it is not charging a fee to consumers that are using service integrating MasterCard Send but these businesses could charge a fee directly to consumers if they choose. It’s not particularly surprising that MasterCard is following in the footsteps of Square and PayPal in entering into peer to peer payments. Facing the heat from payments upstarts, the company has been experimenting with new technologies such as facial recognition software, touchless transactions and more. ;p2p/p2b;http://fortune.com/2015/05/19/mastercard-p2p-payments/
214;Facebook Releases New P2P Payment Feature. What’s Next?Facebook has just announced the release of a new “P2P” payment feature incorporated in its messenger service. The application will allow users to send & receive money to each other using their platform. Facebook launched the service saying “it is easy, and it is free”.  The service is expected to be available for US desktop and mobile users in the coming months. With its more than billion users and over 500 million of those people using Messenger, this payment platform has potential.It’s easy to see that Zuckerberg’s entry into the P2P payment industry is going to spell trouble for existing industry leaders. An interesting question is what effect, if any, will it have on the crowdfunding industry?Money US DollarsSo the new feature will work much like other existing payment services. Currently the system is expected to only permit “debit” account transfers (purportedly to keep the service free) but permitting “credit” transactions is inevitable. Once registered, a user will be able to select a “friend” (which technically could be a business’ page)  through Facebook messenger and send that person money by simply clicking a button. Assuming the receiver has their account information set up they would just click to accept the payment (much like Chase QuickPay). The transfer of the money itself will be instant however, depending on the receiver’s bank, it may take 1-3 business days for the money to actually show up in their account.With the growing number of mobile based payment services such as Apple Pay and Venmo (the PayPal owned app) the mobile payment industry is expected to grow to close to $150 Billion over the next five years. As a result, it’s no wonder why Facebook sees an opportunity here given that more than half of its user base (over 745 million users) accesses Facebook through some form of mobile device. In fact, the introduction of a P2P payment service by Facebook has actually been expected since mid-2014 when the company hired of David Marcus, former PayPal president. Facebook is clearly entering a very crowded industry, especially with the recent release of Apple Pay. None of its competitors however, except perhaps Apple, have the reach or resources that Facebook does so I doubt they are worried about the competition.So what does this have to do with crowdfunding? The simple answer is, nothing … at least for now…Mark Zuckerberg 4By its own terms of service (see “Making Purchases” # 7 ) the new Facebook payment system is “not intended to be used for business, commercial, or merchant transactions.” However, the potential for disruption in the crowdfunding industry is HUGE should Facebook decide there is opportunity there. Now before I continue this discussion let me first say that I have seen no evidence that Facebook has any intention of entering the crowdfunding industry (or even knows it exists). That being said, is it easy to see how Facebook might end up moving in that direction.Take reward/donation based crowdfunding for example. With sites like GoFoundMe, Kickstarter and Indiegogo, users set up a crowdfunding campaign asking the “crowd” to help fund their idea/project. What’s the first thing users usually do once they create that campaign? That’s right, you guessed it, shoot out an announcement about the campaign to their friends and family on Facebook and other social media sites. How easy do you think it would be for Facebook to create a means to start similar crowdfunding campaigns, and fund those campaigns, directly through their site? Moreover, given the amount of customer preference data Facebook already collects (don’t believe anything different) Facebook could actually better market the campaigns by targeting advertising to select users based on the project/idea.ONE SPARK, the worlds first crowdfunding festival at PLATOON KUNSTHALLE in Berlin.Let’s move now to investment based crowdfunding. I admit this connection is VERY tenuous, but you have to agree – there IS potential.If/when Title III crowdfunding is made legal, it seems to me that the Facebook user base would be THE optimum marketing target for such investments. Now should Facebook want to capitalize on this fact it could simply partner with (or just purchase) a crowdfunding portal and make it so that their investment portal is the only portal that could advertise through Facebook. That is a lot of “what ifs” I know, but should they ever happen I could not see an issuer using any another crowdfunding portal but Facebook’s.Like ButtonWhile Facebook’s new P2P payment is sure to shake things up in the mobile payment industry, chances are that it will have little to no effect on the crowdfunding industry. The potential does exists however, and you never know what is going on in Zuckerberg’s head. I can tell you this, if Facebook ever does decide to move its monster of a company into the crowdfunding industry the playing field is going to look a lot different than it does today…And then the next step will be providing credit with peer to peer loans;p2p/p2b;http://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2015/03/64747-facebook-releases-new-p2p-payment-feature-whats-next/
215;"Mobile wallet Xendit targets Indonesia’s P2P payment marketAlthough BlackBerry Money hasn’t gained any traction in Indonesia, it hasn’t stopped other startups from aiming at the peer-to-peer payment segment with mobile based solutions. One of these companies is Xendit, a mobile wallet that not only stores credit (or funds) but also can be connected to a debit card account. We spoke with Founder Vivek Ahuja about Xendit’s optimism.Currently, Xendit is in public beta mode, with the final version available next month, according to Ahuja. Available in both Android and iOS, he said when the transaction is larger than funds in the wallet, it can be withdrawn from a bank/debit card account to complete the transaction.He said, “The launch version will allow users to connect their debit cards, send funds to friends, withdraw wallet funds to a bank account, and refer their friends to the product. The product will only support IDR to IDR transactions.”Also Read: Ardent Capital’s WhatsNew expands into Indonesia as MOXYIndonesia does’t have a peer-to-peer payment solution platformWhen asked on why Xendit is catering to Indonesians, Ahuja answered, “When we interviewed customers throughout the world to develop this product, we were just shocked to hear about the norms of peer-to-peer payment for young, tech-savvy Indonesians. Despite the mobile solutions that you’ve already alluded to, Indonesians still resort to paying each other with cash, IOUs [I Owe You], and bank wire transfers.”“We think we can succeed because we are going to be the only entrant focussed on making the peer-to-peer transfer experience as simple as possible – other peer-to-peer payment solutions in Indonesia have typically just been “features” added to other product offerings developed by telcos, banks, or device companies, not products in themselves,” he optimistically added.On bringing the solution to Indonesia, Ahuja confirmed they are working with local financial institutions. Although preferring not the discuss the detail of financial partnerships, he commented, “Part of our value is that the value of our product will not be dependent on the user having a specific bank account.”Xandit will focus on the 18-35 year old urban Indonesian demographic; they have a debit card and a smartphone, buy things online, and goes out with friends two to three times a week.Also Read: Finding the right cultural fit for your next job just got easierFuture plansWhat about Xandit’s business model? Ahuja explains, “Our business model right now is focussed on just acquiring customers and growing a large, dense network of peer-to-peer transactions. Only after that network is established, we can monetise the product in several different ways (either by creating a two-sided market, product expansion or geographic expansion).”";p2p/p2b;http://e27.co/mobile-wallet-xendit-targets-indonesias-p2p-payment-market-20150701/
216;Facebook Instant P2P Payments and the Future of MoneyThe prestigious MIT Technology Review has published a Business Report on “The Future of Money.”The report surveys emerging digital money and online payment technologies, including Apple Pay, Alibaba’s Alipay and Bitcoin, and concludes that promising advances will be integrated with mainstream fintech and controlled by large players.“As technology-driven payment ideas give cash a run for its money, the big winners could be established banks and credit card companies,” the report begins, and goes on to describe fintech advances such as digital wallets, cryptocurrencies and mobile peer-to-peer payments.“Which technologies and companies are likely to lead this transformation is the big question for this Business Report,” the report reads.The MIT Technology Review report missed by a few days the announcement, reported by TechCrunch and also covered by The New York Times, that Facebook unveiled a new payments feature for Facebook Messenger.The new Facebook payment features allows users to connect their Visa or Mastercard debit cards and send friends money on iOS, Android and desktop with zero fees. Facebook Messenger payments will roll out first in the United States over the coming months.“We use secure systems that encrypt the connection between you and Facebook as well as your card information when you ask us to store it for you,” says the Facebook announcement. “We use layers of software and hardware protection that meet the highest industry standards. These payment systems are kept in a secured environment that is separate from other parts of the Facebook network and that receive additional monitoring and control. A team of anti-fraud specialists monitor for suspicious purchase activity to help keep accounts safe.”Facebook doesn’t charge payment fees because it doesn’t have to monetize payments. For Facebook, it’s enough to keep users locked in the hugely popular Messenger app instead of switching to a dedicated payment service such as PayPal or Google Wallet to send money to friends.Messenger is one of the largest platforms in the world, with more than 500 million monthly users. And last year Facebook spent nearly $22 billion to buy WhatsApp, a separate messaging platform that now counts more than 700 million active users globally.The new integrated payment features, which are fast, easy to use and secured by solid technology and operating practices, could make digital friend-to-friend payments and micropayments commonplace.“[C]onversations about money are already happening on Messenger,” as people chat about bar tabs, splitting dinner bills, and sharing the cost of an Uber, Facebook’s product manager Steve Davis told TechCrunch. “What we want to do is make it easy to finish the conversation in the same place you started. You don’t have to switch to another app.”Given Facebook’s huge size and reach, the introduction of its payments feature is likely to disrupt the emerging market for instant P2P payments, notes The New York Times. And analysts said that if the payment system succeeded, Facebook would extend it to other types of purchases, such as consumers’ buying of products directly from advertisers.With this announcement, the social networking giant seems to be claiming a place among the large companies that, according to the MIT Technology Review report, will be the big winners in the digital fintech arena.The Facebook announcement doesn’t mention Bitcoin. But it would be technically easy to add a Bitcoin wallet besides a credit card, and send bitcoin payments to the wallet of the recipient. That leaves open the option for Facebook to integrate bitcoin payments.Blogger Jimmy Song suspects that bitcoin payments may indeed be part of Facebook’s long-term plan. He notes that David Marcus, the former PayPal president who now runs Facebook’s Messenger division, has been a fan of bitcoin for a long time.;p2p/p2b;https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/facebook-instant-p2p-payments-future-money-1426709013
217;"ERPB pushes pan-European P2P mobile payments The Euro Retail Payments Board (ERPB) says that person-to-person mobile payment providers across the continent should work together to ensure interoperability.Following its latest meeting, the ERPB (set up by the ECB as a successor to the Sepa Council), says that it has agreed to ""endorse the vision"" of allowing anyone to carry out a pan-European P2P mobile payment using a ""simple method"".At the moment, says the board, there is fragmentation among providers, with around 50 local systems. Any new offering should seek to work with these, rather than try to provide a competitor.To get interoperability, outfits offering P2P payments should make the most of existing infrastructure such as Sepa and Ibans, and build a harmonised process to allow data like mobile phone numbers, email addresses and Ibans to be exchanged across borders.Meanwhile, the ERPB has mandated the European Payments Council (EPC) to design a pan-European scheme for instant payments in euro by November 2015. The board set the wheels in motion for a system in December after expressing concern that the emergence of new domestic platforms, such as the UK's Faster Payments scheme, might end up creating a fragmented market in Europe for instant payments, similar to what existed in regular payments in the past.Having set up a task force and issued an initial assessment, the EPC will now come up with a proposal for the design of an instant Sepa Credit Transfer scheme, (SCTinst), which could be adhered to by EU payment service providers on a voluntary basis";p2p/p2b;http://www.finextra.com/news/fullstory.aspx?newsitemid=27572

Me link to co-workers to chip in for an engagement present for another co-worker"".PayPal. Me's launch has come just weeks after online-bidding site eBay spun off the digital-payment platform. The move was widely celebrated on the Wall Street, and allowed PayPal to operate as an independent company without requiring approval from its corporate overlord eBay.Recently, PayPal conducted a study 'Money Habits Study', whose results showed that adults across the world are owed a collective $51 billion in small debts from friends and family. The same study found that many of those debts may go uncollected because over 50% of Americans find it awkward to ask their friends or family to pay them back.

220;Is Facebook Now Payments’ Biggest Threat?Last week’s Innovation Project 2015 was all about “Innovation at the Intersections”  – a nod to the influence of the many powerful ecosystems that are now shaping the future of payments and commerce. Our two days of discussion focused on the extent to which the individual and collective actions of those ecosystems either create big crashes and traffic jams at those intersections or an orderly crossing to a new, digital payments and commerce future.Or maybe a little of each.A lot of what happens, of course, depends on who does what and how – and when. That’s why Facebook’s launch of its P2P payments capability via its Messenger app has made a lot of people a little nervous about Facebook positioning itself to become the “next big thing” in payments.Until last Tuesday, Facebook was brushed aside by lots of folks, including me, as a social platform that had failed pretty miserably at igniting payments and commerce on its social network. At one time, and not all that long ago, Facebook just seemed like the perfect “walled garden” in which to launch commerce – a captive audience of hundreds of millions of consumers who checked Facebook multiple times a day and spent 20 minutes there stalking their friends, uploading photos and liking pages.Except that commerce on Facebook – outside of that driven by advertising on Facebook  – has had a very rocky history.As a social network, Facebook is all about broadcasting (aka boasting) updates to friends. Want to brag to your network about hopping on a plane and heading to St. Barts in February when the rest of us slobs are under 11 feet of snow in Boston? Facebook has just the status update for you.But that same rule applied to broadcasting shopping “updates” can get pretty complicated.People are funny about how much info about their spending habits they want to share with their network. Maybe they’d like to keep their husband from knowing that they just bought another pair of Jimmy Choos. Then again, maybe they don’t want their friends to know they did either since they’d prefer not to see them wearing the same pair at the next cocktail party they attend together. Or maybe they just don’t think that it’s any of anyone’s business what they buy, how often and how much they spend when they do go shopping. And, since most people don’t really understand how to manage their privacy settings to limit who sees what updates, there’s always this nagging fear that any action taken on Facebook, including buying stuff, would be open to the whole world to see and, therefore, to know.So, between Facebook’s early attempt at commerce via Beacon (which spoiled an engagement surprise by broadcasting that a guy bought a ring for his girl and planned to propose), the Facebook Credits closure, the shuttering of Gifts, and the change in the news feed algorithms that made it impossibly expensive for merchants to use Facebook to message their fans with an offer to buy something, the notion of commerce on Facebook pretty much came to a grinding halt a couple of years ago.As did anyone’s expectations of payments and commerce igniting on the social network.Which is why Messenger, and its payments ambitions, is now such an interesting topic of conversation.Messenger has 700 million consumers who message each other every day – and a lot. The number of messages sent each day via Messenger isn’t reported, but we do know that What’s App, which Facebook also owns, is said to generate 30 billion messages a DAY among its 700 million user base. Even if Messenger generates 50 percent of that volume, that’s a lotta messages flying back and forth between people – in private.And between people who span all age brackets.In 2012, Pew reported that 80 percent of people – young and old-  who own smartphones, text. Three years later, that number is probably even higher. Boomers learned to text since it was among the only way to communicate with their offspring –and smartphones with keyboards made keeping tabs on junior simple and fast. And messaging others, an easy habit to develop.Messenger also has David Marcus, former PayPal President, at the helm. David is a mobile guy who started and sold a few mobile-focused ventures, including Zong, which PayPal acquired in 2011. While at PayPal, Marcus no doubt got schooled on payments and the fact that, payments is above all, a risk business. It’s therefore not a big surprise that Messenger’s P2P capability leverages the existing credit and debit card rails to enable people who are already connected with each other in some way to send money to each other – for free (for now). (I can’t wait for all of the friend requests to come streaming in from Nigerian royalty.) Sending money to friends via existing credit and debit cards is a very clever way to authenticate the identity of the sender and receiver of the funds. By leveraging a network of people who are already known to each other – and who have been vetted by their issuer to have a credit or debit account – gives Messenger a good way to authenticate the identity of sender and receiver and reduce the risk that either the sender or the receiver of the funds aren’t who they say they are.Messenger also has one other important characteristic that the Facebook social network doesn’t – and that’s the ability to enable one-to-one interactions. Of course, groups can chat and do, but for the most part, messaging is done between two people, in private. When Facebook spun off Messenger, it also cut the cord from its social network mother ship –  and jettisoned any potential baggage associated with doing activities more appropriate in a one-to-one environment – like paying people and businesses and merchants – from those designed for a much more social and one-to-many setting – like posting pictures of the kids, dogs and grandkids.Marcus says he has always admired China’s WeChat platform and used it as the inspiration for his vision of what Messenger could become. That suggests that P2P is likely Messenger’s first act.Like Messenger, WeChat started as a chat platform but over the last several years has evolved to become much more – a network of 1.1 billion people of whom ~470 million are active users. Payments is embedded in WeChat and registered users can send each other money, buy tickets, pay bills, hail and pay for taxis and order and pay for stuff from storefronts that operate on its platform. It can also enable the payment of items in store via QR codes. In a relatively short period of time, WeChat has evolved to become the top influencer of luxury brand preference of Chinese consumers, too. And, it has done this by embedding payments capabilities inside a network that has become an ecosystem central to the lifestyle of the Chinese consumer.Facebook and its announcement of payments via Messenger also made a bit more tangible a few of the key themes that we discussed last week at Innovation Project 2015.For instance, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, creator of the World Wide Web (and iPhone owner), stunned the crowd on Wednesday morning when he suggested that innovation in payments needs to be independent of any device. Innovation can only flourish, he believes, when people can enable any commerce opportunity via any connected device – securely. His frame of reference, of course, is the Internet and the World Wide Web, which can be accessed via any device at any time, including the most basic of phones. That, he believes, is why the Web has become so central to our existence and in just 26 years has grown to some 4.58 billion pages. And also why apps like WeChat and Alipay and PayPal have hundreds of millions of users – their dependencies are entirely a function of the value associated with creating an account and using it, not on which devices they own. (I didn’t ask, and he didn’t have an opportunity to explain why Apple, which only innovates on its own hardware, has been so much more successful – by the vote of the people who buy, plus our own Pii360 innovation index, than Google’s Android which adopts the open hardware approach.)That “software trumps hardware all day long” theme surfaced later that same day when the debate over mobile versus apps in the retail setting was raised. There was a pretty divided camp over apps and the ability of smartphones to accommodate zillions of them and the friction associated with having to ask consumers to download and then use them. The smart money’s on responsive design, and the ability for consumers to have a better Web experience on their phones or tablets by simply having the Web adapt to those smaller screens.Of course, that will only trigger commerce if payment can be made both easy and frictionless. We all realize that the future of payments is not about payments at all but about making the act of payment invisible and a part of something else  – searching for (and then booking) a flight, searching for (and then buying) a concert or a movie ticket, searching for (and then ordering) something online to pick up in a store, even – for example –  being reminded to stop into the dry cleaners to pick up clothes when in the vicinity of the store and then having that service automatically charged to the account registered at that store.That whole notion was debated further during the discussion of the latest Apple Pay adoption results, led by “Hooked” author, Nir Eyal and InfoScout CEO Jared Schrieber. Without ubiquity, it seems pretty clear that consumers have to be given a reason – and a reward – to remember to break an old payments habit to create a new one. The act of payment alone isn’t enough of a hook for most people to go to the trouble – not knowing whether a new form of payment is accepted creates more friction than simply whipping out a plastic card that consumers know works just about everywhere they go.Making payments invisible also implies a need to take the security game up a few (dozen) notches. The discussion with General Keith Alexander and Kevin Mandia from FireEye was as terrifying as it was enlightening. A shift away from efforts focused simply on authorizing transactions to those that can authenticate the identity of the consumer or business initiating those transactions is the imperative for payments moving forward. And, of course, doing it in a way that doesn’t introduce friction in the relationships that businesses want to have with their consumers.Friction of course, was a key theme over the course of the two days. Solving for frictions in payments and commerce is what’s giving rise to the emergence of mobile money schemes in developing countries and better ways of moving money across border for commerce and business purposes. But despite the spirited debate over the degree to which cryptocurrency and software could make both easier and cheaper, few walked away convinced that innovators using software to leverage rails and networks already in place and already in compliance was a far better option than ditching them for “free” unregulated crypto-enabled rails.And, of course, we learned on Thursday morning that the most innovative players in payments aren’t traditional payments companies at all. The results of the Pii360 Payments Innovation Index revealed that 6 of the top highest ranking companies are technology companies – Apple, Amazon, Facebook, PayPal, Google, and Alibaba – companies whose core business isn’t payments but are interested in payments because it’s complementary to their commerce capabilities. What’s also stunning is how many traditional payments companies, including some of the giants of the industry, didn’t make it into the Top 10 or even to the top of the 10 segments we examined as part of our work.I suppose if you wanted validation of the relevance of the “innovation at the intersections” concept, Pii360 sort of spells it all out for you.Which brings me full circle to Facebook.We got a hint of the potential impact that Facebook could have on payments when we reviewed the initial results of Pii360 about six weeks ago. At that time, we saw what most of you did a few days ago – Facebook beating out three existing payments networks, all of the issuers and even PayPal. It was, at first, a puzzle.But in addition to scoring highly on market/company indicators and the expert survey, Facebook has been methodically investing in payments patents, as evidenced by the massive war chest of patents it has accumulated. Facebook’s patent war chest is only slightly less valuable than Visa’s and Amazon’s who, combined, have been in payments about 10 times longer than Facebook has been in existence.Their high scoring also reveals an incredibly valuable takeaway from our work in benchmarking payments innovation.Payments innovation is like an iceberg, it’s what you can’t see that’s critical.In other words, Facebook probably isn’t the only company that should keep you up at night, sweating bullets. There are undoubtedly others who are making investments in payments that aren’t all that visible yet, but will pop up when they feel the time is right.Which for Facebook and Messenger was last week – and well timed to coincide with its F8 Developer Conference and PayPal’s impending IPO.Of course, all we have at the moment is an announcement.As we all know, the proof is in the execution. If Messenger can execute on its payments ambitions, it could become an interesting new player at the intersection of payments and commerce and maybe even cause a few multi-car pileups in the process.In the U.S., P2P is a crowded field and the domain of a bunch of players – some more established and entrenched than others – PayPal, Venmo, Square, SnapCash and bank-led clearXchange, not to mention WeChat which has 100 million users (including me – it’s great!) outside of China and Alipay. And Facebook has tried a number of prior payments experiments that have fumbled badly in the payments and commerce space.But embedding payment inside of messaging is also an interesting way for merchants to explore the one-to-one, personalized, commerce relationship that they seek with their customers. Texting is being used now by businesses to confirm appointments, message about statuses and send useful information that typically generates an immediate action, often 25 to 30 percent higher response rates than via email.So don’t be surprised if at Facebook’s F8 developer conference this week, you hear Marcus invite developers to write commerce apps for Messenger that can leverage the registered payments card accounts that it hopes to create – or even act as an incentive for consumers to register them in the first place. It’s a short hop from sending money to friends to enabling the purchase of things that people do socially with their friends – tickets to movies or concerts, taking trips, pitching in for group gifts, going out to eat and splitting the check, etc.But it’s not a slam dunk.Unlike WeChat, Messenger has the headwinds of building a user base in the U.S. (which is where it is launching) alongside others that have tens and even hundreds of millions of registered users and that offer P2P alongside a portfolio of payments and commerce services that create additional value and utility for consumers, merchants and businesses. WeChat’s success – and even Japan’s Line – is the result of filling a void by eliminating the friction of doing basic things like payments and commerce in a connected world. The environment in the U.S. is vastly different as are the expectations of its consumers who increasingly find friction in having to use multiple, different apps to do similar things.For Messenger to be successful, it will have to solve a problem for consumers that isn’t being addressed today by any existing solution. Will just offering P2P payments capabilities be enough for them to build a payments business? Well, it wasn’t for Square, which found that P2P did diddly-squat to build its own consumer wallet platform which it shuttered a while back. Or Amazon which shut down its P2P capabilities less than a year after introducing it. Or even Google which continues to struggle to ignite payments on or offline.Messenger will have to quickly introduce something that solves a problem or unlocks other value to capture the consumer’s interest – and as we learned from the “Hooked” discussion last week, getting consumers off of one thing that works for them today and onto another isn’t ever easy. Even if you have 700 million users in your sandbox.But having a new player in the space with a different approach makes being at the intersection of payments and commerce and innovation a whole lot more interesting, don’t you think?;p2p/p2b;http://www.pymnts.com/news/2015/ferguson-turns-to-crowdsourcing-to-rebuild-broken-business/
221;Google Wallet adds P2P paymentsGoogle has released a new Wallet app for iOS with a clear focus on peer-to-peer payments and wallet-to-bank transfers.The update enables iPhone users to send money to anyone in the US with an email address, even if they are not a Wallet user. A similar service was rolled out for Android phones last month.Under the iOS upgrade, money held on Google Wallet can also be cashed out to a linked debit card or bank account. Other features include the ability to set up recurring cash transfers, bill splitting and instant notifications of money movements in and out of the app. ;p2p/p2b;http://www.finextra.com/news/fullstory.aspx?newsitemid=27878
222;Apple patent suggests peer-to-peer payments could come to Apple PayWeeks after word that Google intends for the old Google Wallet app to live on as a peer-to-peer payments tool, Apple has been granted a patent for its own person-to-person payments technology.The patent describes a system whereby one device user can send a payment to another user’s device securely and at no cost.“In particular, an individual using an electronic device [phone, tablet, laptop] may identify another proximate electronic device of a counterparty in a financial transaction, and may provide an encrypted payment packet to the other electronic device,” the patent reads.Device A can send a token to the email account in Device B, where the user can choose to accept the payment by activating the token.If and when the payee accepts the payment on his or her device, that device then sends the original information packet and another encrypted information packet to a “third party” that completes the transaction. That third party might be either the payor or payee’s bank, or a third-party financial institution.The patent states that the communication method used by the two devices could be near-field communications (NFC) or Bluetooth technology.The patent states that the devices on both ends of the transaction might use biometric sensors (fingerprint readers, most likely) to authenticate the users. The users might also be asked to enter a PIN code.;p2p/p2b;http://venturebeat.com/2015/07/02/apple-patent-suggests-peer-to-peer-payments-could-come-to-apple-pay/
223;Riding the wave of fintech in Indonesia Let me start with a disclaimer. I was in the banking industry for a while. That glamorous career with pretty good pay and a lot of perks was very difficult to leave.Salary was comfortable, not to mention the additional perks such as family medical coverage, corporate car and (heavily) subsidised mortgage. Sometimes I still imagine what life would be like had I stayed in banking.I don’t meet my old colleagues in person too much nowadays. Jakarta is that cruel. You know they’re around but we’re all too busy with our own jobs. And we seldom cross paths. The network of investors and startups don’t mix well with the network of banks. That is, until earlier this year when JP Ellis (founder of Cekaja.com) initiated a financial technology (fintech) meetup which we hosted at our coworking space Comma.Fintech is the new sexy category. Everyone is talking about it. For startups and investors, it’s exciting because of the opportunities ahead. For banks and other financial services, it’s scary because you feel like Indiana Jones being chased by a boulder, you have to keep running without knowing what other dangers lie ahead. It’s that Temple Run game in real life.Everytime I meet my old colleagues in banking now, they ask what is happening in fintech. I think it’s great that they want to learn and try to adapt and ensure they keep being relevant. A bank invited me for a chat with some of their senior management to find out more. An organisation based overseas connected to see what is happening in Indonesia. An embassy of a neighbouring country wants to link up their fintech industry to Indonesia.All of a sudden fintech is as trendy as a heavily-pomaded-pompadour haircut.Is it the end of financial services as we know it?You may have read about some media writing headlines such as “A massive wave of startups is coming to crush the big banks”  and “What banks can learn from media companies that were hit by the digitization tsunami a decade ago”After print media, telcos, radio and TV, are banks the next to lose their dominance? Bill Gates went as far as saying, “Banking is necessary, banks are not.” So is it really the end of the (financial service) world? And specifically for Indonesia, is the change really coming that fast?Indonesian banks have the telcos as a great example. Back in 2000, the mobile revolution started and most Indonesians now have access to mobile phones without ever experiencing landline connections.It isn’t impossible that the 80 percent of Indonesians currently without bank accounts will be transferring money to each other in the near future, without having a bank account.The disruptions are realHas there been any real examples of financial disruption? In more mature markets, we have seen quite a few of them. Let’s look at some memorable ones.In most markets, the digital revolution starts with media and ecommerce. The ecommerce revolution during the first ‘dot com’ boom (late 90s) in the US was led by Ebay and Amazon. US has the highest credit card penetration in the world so payment was actually not a big problem for B2C ecommerce like Amazon. It’s a different story with ebay’s C2C ecommerce model. Only a few sellers had the capability of accepting credit card payments.Then came Paypal.Back then they were the only payment system that allows peer-to-peer money transfer using debit/credit cards. The rest was history. The majority of Ebay transactions were (and still are) completed using Paypal. After Paypal’s successful IPO, Ebay ended up acquiring the majority shares valuing them at S1.5 billion in 2002. An unprecedented amount for a tech company at the time. And Paypal is still very much a major force of the US payment industry up to this day.Not to mention they also created the ‘Paypal Mafia‘, former founders and employees who have risen in importance and become household names in the tech industry as entrepreneurs and investors.Last year, LendingClub became the first peer-to-peer lender to go public, with valuation of approximately US$8 billion. Not bad for a startup launched in 2007 to reach that kind of valuation in 7 years. But what is more important is that they disrupted the main function of a (retail) bank: an intermediary. With LendingClub (and so many other P2P lenders), people can get a loan financed by other people directly. This means better margins for everyone and leaves banks with nothing but being a place to store the money.InVenture is very interesting because their credit scoring enables better microloans, giving even more access to people using their mobile phones. One of the most painful problems for Indonesian banks have been the unavailability of credit scores for first-time borrowers, and they solved it quite well. Thanks to InVenture’s credit score, many people can get microcredits that they previously could not access.Square just filed for IPO last week. Huge news in Silicon Valley not because of the size of their IPO, but whether Jack Dorsey can maintain both his positions in Square AND Twitter. Businesswise, Square is a serious contender for banks’ card acquiring (EDC) business.Outside those US cases, you cannot look away from Alipay’s dominance in the Chinese payment market. Their size is now estimated to be 3 times Paypal (in terms of transaction volume), making them the biggest payment platform in the world. They managed to solve the problem for a lot of customers, and also parent company Alibaba’s problem for completing transactions. Most of their Chinese users have never owned a credit card. And guess what? They are seriously moving into other Asian markets, including Indonesia.In terms of financial inclusion, the story of M-Pesa in Kenya has become legendary. The country jumps from a huge number of unbanked population to being cashless now, thanks to the ability to transfer and transact through mobile phones. Most of M-Pesa’s users still do not own a (traditional) bank account but are transacting very activelyEven closer to home, there are a couple of startups trying to solve a remittance problem for Filipino migrant workers to send money to their family back home. This is a huge space as the Philippines is the world’s third largest remittance market after India and China. They are all still at a very early stage but it’s definitely a very interesting space to watch.What’s happening in Indonesia?It is amazing how much is actually happening in the Indonesian fintech space without the banks or other large financial institutions knowing. There are a couple of banks who are very serious about ‘countering’ and working to avoid the threats. But most bankers I met have never heard of any of these fintech startups:•Cekaja•Bareksa•Kreditgogo•Stockbit•Bitcoin Indonesia•Jojonomic•Veryfund•Uangteman•Doku•Codapay•Kartuku•Veritrans•Aturduit•Moka•Cermati(Disclaimer: list may not be exhaustive, but these are the ones that our team have had a look at some point)After 3 meetups in Comma, some of the fintech initiators took to formalise it to be an association: Asosiasi Penyelenggara Teknologi Jasa Finansial. Kudos to the initiators for the collaborative effort! Some bank representatives were involved, but the number is still very small. If banks are serious about it, they should be much more involved, before it’s too late to join the party.What can banks and other traditional financial institutions do?I personally believe it should not be a zero-sum game. Even Gates said that banking is still going to be important. Paypal and Alipay still run on top of the existing bank accounts (and credit cards, in Paypal’s case). Even P2P lenders still work on top of basic bank accounts. The scary part is that the banks don’t have control of the money going back and forth in their system. Looking at the ‘best’ practices from around the world, there seems to be a couple things they can do:1.Invest in the startups to align and enjoy the gains. If you can’t fight them, join and support them. Many international banks have set up their own corporate VC and set aside some funds to invest in the startups. These are some that I have heard of:– Barclays– CitiVentures– BBVA Ventures– Santander InnoVentures– SBT Venture Capital– HSBC Ventures2.Be a part of the ecosystem. In most startup ecosystems, one of the important components is incubators/accelerators. Banks can easily be partner/supporter/sponsor for these programs. They should allow some of their executives to be mentors in the program to help the entrepreneurs. Some startup incubators have set up in Asia:– Nest– Fintech Innovation Lab– Startupbootcamp Fintech“Let’s start tomorrow then!”Before jumping into the ocean, there are a few words of caution:•A venture investment mindset is totally different from traditional banking and lending. As someone who have experienced this firsthand, I can only say that you should prepare your mindset and reset your thinking about business. Having said that, the instinct of risk management gained from banking has helped me a lot (although the mitigations can be very different).•Remember that most startups fail. The famous myth says the rate is 9 out of 10, but research has said that the failure rate to reach 10th year is about 75 percent.•Be ready to double-down on the successful ones. Just like in the casino, you might want to risk more if you sense that you have been dealt a good hand.•Be involved in nurturing the ecosystem. The Indonesian entrepreneurship/startup ecosystem only started around 5 years ago. There are still a lot of things that need development, and it can only be done by the players who are already in it: entrepreneur capacity building, other investors (angels, VCs, PEs), mentors, and definitely for fintech: regulators.•Don’t do things by yourself. The key is collaboration and partnerships. Note that a lot of the corporate VCs and accelerators in the examples above were born out of a collaboration between a bank and another experienced partner. If you think you are too big to work with someone smaller, that’s exactly the kind of mindset Goliath had before David slayed him with his slingshot;p2p/p2b;https://www.techinasia.com/talk/fintech-primer-indonesia/
224;BlackBerry Picks PayPal For P2P PaymentsAfter launching the PayPal app on its platform earlier this year, BlackBerry has now partnered with PayPal to power a P2P money transfer channel on its BBM app.Upon connecting a PayPal account to the BBM app, users can now start sending and receiving money to/from other users.“It’s really simple: select the PayPal ‘Send Money’ icon in BBM and connect your PayPal account. You can start sending money to family and friends once they’ve also connected their PayPal accounts to BBM. From there, you’ll simply select the PayPal icon directly in BBM, enter in the amount of money, review the details and hit send — that’s all it takes,” the company explained in a blog post.Currently, the money transfer functionality, which doesn’t require users to have a PayPal app, has been made available in a private beta mode to Blackberry, iOS and Android BBM users in Canada and would be rolled out to other countries in the coming weeks.With the rollout of the BBM money transfer option, BlackBerry users now have two transfer options, the other being to transfer money via the PayPal app, which BlackBerry launched on its platform in January this year.Blackberry’s effort to improve P2P lending on its platform comes amidst a range of changes the company is making to revive its mobile business.The company recently launched a new enterprise-focused Software-as-a-Service, BES12 Cloud, which offers mobile-friendly business solutions for the BYOD trend.Recently, reports from various news outlets also hinted at Blackberry’s possible plan to launch Android-powered devices.;p2p/p2b;http://www.pymnts.com/news/2015/blackberry-picks-paypal-for-p2p-payments/

226;10 Surprising Facts About Peer-To-Peer Payment Apps Like Venmo and Square CashAs mobile technology continues to become more and more advanced, it wouldn’t be surprising if the need for cash someday disappeared — especially when it comes to lending people money.Peer-to-peer (P2P) payment apps allow customers to easily transfer money to one another with their smartphones and mobile devices. While apps such as Venmo, Square Cash and Google Wallet certainly haven’t yet rendered cash irrelevant, their popularity suggests that the arrival of some type of cash-killing technology isn’t far away. Even social media sites Facebook and Snapchat have entered the P2P market with Snapcash and Facebook Messenger’s new payment option.The P2P trend doesn’t show any signs of slowing down, and you might be shocked by how much some of these apps have grown and how much money is being transferred through them. Below are 10 surprising facts, figures and statistics about Venmo, other P2P apps and the P2P industry, in general:1. The volume of global P2P payments is more than $1 trillion.A Business Insider (BI) Intelligence report found that just a tiny fraction of those global transactions are conducted through mobile phones. In the U.S., only $5 billion of the payments are via mobile phones.2. Mobile payments in the U.S. are predicted to reach at least $86 billion.According to the BI Intelligence report, P2P mobile transactions could reach $86 billion in the U.S. alone by 2018. But the National Retail Federation predicted in 2013 that U.S. mobile payments will actually reach $90 billion in 2017.3. PayPal acquired Venmo through Braintree.Two college roommates created Venmo and sold it five months later in 2012 to Braintree for $26.2 million. PayPal, which is owned by eBay, bought Braintree in 2013 for $800 million. When news about the acquisition came out, TechCrunch reported that Venmo’s P2P payment capability is what attracted PayPal to Braintree.4. Venmo is handling more than $1 billion in P2P payments a year.In May 2014, Braintree CEO Bill Ready wrote that the app is growing at a quarter-over-quarter rate of 62 percent.Read: 5 Perks of Peer-to-Peer Lending5. Venmo’s transaction volume is tied with Starbucks’ volume.In the fourth quarter of 2012, Venmo’s transaction volume totaled $59 million, which is less than half of Starbucks’ volume during that time. By the first quarter of 2014, the two were equal at $314 million, reports The Financial Brand, which sourced BI Intelligence.6. “Venmo” is becoming an accepted verb.Although not yet in the dictionary, people are using “Venmo” as a verb — not just a noun. For example, app users will say, “Venmo me later” instead of, “Pay me back later.” Jordan McKee, a senior analyst at Yankee Group, told Bloomberg Business, “Any time your brand becomes a verb, you’ve made a pretty profound impact.”7. Millennials account for about 55 percent of all P2P transactions.A 2014 Nielsen report found that 18-to-34 year olds account for more than 50 percent of those who use payment apps. And, according to Fortune, Venmo is “the payments app millennials swear by.” Meanwhile, only 35 percent of users are between 35 and 54 years old.8. Almost half of P2P payment app users utilize the apps for dining purposes.The Nielsen report also found that 49 percent of P2P payment app users report using the apps while dining. Other purposes for the apps include gifts (44 percent), entertainment (43 percent), merchandise (39 percent), household bills (36 percent), transportation (36 percent) and rent (19 percent). Fifteen percent of users have reported using the apps to transfer money to family members and friends overseas, as well.9. Africa’s mobile payment market is booming.According to a Gallup analysis, sub-Sahara Africa is the fastest growing mobile technology market. A Pew Research Center survey found that 61 percent of mobile owners in Kenya use their cell phones to transfer money — but according to the BI Intelligence report, 92 percent of Kenyans have said they used mobile P2P payments.10. You can send up to $10,000 a day with Google Wallet.P2P payment apps have limits on how much money can be transferred in a certain amount of time. While Google Wallet allows up to $10,000 per day (with a total limit of $50,000 per five-day period) for transfers in and out of Wallet balances, Venmo has a $2,999.99 rolling weekly limit. With Square Cash, there’s an initial weekly spending limit of $250 for personal use Cash accounts, but it can be increased to $2,500 in most states.;p2p/p2b;http://www.gobankingrates.com/personal-finance/10-surprising-peer-to-peer-payment-apps-like-venmo-square-cash/
227;Transfast expands online p2p payment network across AfricaTransfast, a leading provider of online, cross-border p2p payments solutions, today announced the expansion of its proprietary bank network into 23 African nations – the most extensive of its kind on the continent. Transfast’s network enables people in the U.S. and Canada, and soon from the U.K. and EU, to send money online or via mobile, directly into recipients’ bank accounts at nearly 600 banks or to 6,000 cash pick-up locations inside banks in Africa.Transfast’s African banking network will cover up to 90 percent of adult bank account holders in the 23 nations it serves. Transfast customers will be able to send money via mobile, online or even in person to recipients of funds transfers. Direct deposits are currently available at banks in Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, Gambia, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Ethiopia and Mali, and another 17 countries will be deployed this summer, including Benin, Bissau, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Chad, Comoros, Congo, Egypt, Guinea, Guinea Mauritania, Morocco Niger, Sierra Leone and Togo.“Our direct to bank initiatives further the financial inclusion goals of governments in Africa,” says Samish Kumar, CEO. “As banking penetration grows in Africa, our bank product capability is the most efficient and cost-effective way to receive funds. For unbanked recipients, the ability to pick up cash at a bank provides a positive experience in a bank environment and is a first step toward becoming banked.”According to the World Bank, direct bank deposits and electronic payments play an important role in building financial inclusion by further engaging account holders in the banking system. Studies show that when people participate in the financial system, they are better able to start saving, expand businesses, invest in education, manage risk and absorb financial shocks. Access to accounts and to savings and payment mechanisms increases savings, empowers women, and boosts productive investment and consumption.Transfast.com’s Nigerian customer Victor Olowokere of New York says that Transfast’s direct-to-bank product enables him to save more money, compared with sending cash.“When I send my family cash, it’s rare that any of it gets saved, as there are always needs – books for school or medical bills,” Olowokere says. “I send money to an account which is used only for savings.”In addition to providing the greatest reach, Transfast’s self-owned bank network also provides the greatest value and transparency – senders pay the same flat fee and receive locked-in rates to send to all eight African nations currently online. Bank deposits arrive within a day, and sometimes instantly. Cash is delivered in minutes.;p2p/p2b;http://www.finextra.com/news/announcement.aspx?pressreleaseid=60496
228;Visa Prepares European Tokens And P2P PaymentsApple Pay is coming closer to reality in Europe as Visa prepares for a mid-April launch of  a tokenization service customized for the European marketplace.The practice of swapping out a 16-digit credit card number with a basically meaningless token number is considered a necessary component in the future of payments security, and has been since Apple chose to make it the central security feature for Apple Pay.Steve Perry, Visa Europe’s chief digital officer, noted in an interview that his firm’s plan for secure credit card data transmission parallels what Visa Inc offers in the United States. He declined to comment on whether Apple Pay had agreed to use Visa’s tokens in European markets.“Apple and Visa (Inc) have an agreement around what has happened,” Perry said. “I am as excited as anyone, but we have to wait,” he added. The Visa Europe executive referred further questions to Apple.Visa’s announcements this week were not all about tokens, however.  The firm has also announced an intention to create a peer-to-peer payment service that will allow users to transfer cash, in real time, using just a mobile phone number or Visa card number.The service will be called Visa Direct and will supplant Visa Personal Payments, the existing P2P protocol with about 200K users in Europe. It will be hooked in to Facebook and Twitter to allow users to transfer funds between social media services.Visa has additionally rolled out an API to make it easy for banks to integrate the service, and is geared for a summer 2015 launch.;p2p/p2b;http://www.pymnts.com/news/2015/visa-prepares-european-tokens-and-p2p-payments/
229;What Facebook can gain from its P2P payment service Social networking giant Facebook announced this week that it will add a new feature to its messaging app that will enable users to send and receive money via the platform.People who add their Visa or MasterCard debit card information to Facebook Messenger can make payments to their “friends” in a simple way.One just needs to strike up a conversation, select a “$” icon that appears in the message box, key in the amount and press “pay” for the cash transfer to go through.All that the friend — the counterparty–  has to do is open his message box and click to accept the payment.Facebook users can only add their debit card information for now, an arrangement aimed at minimizing fraud and avoiding fees.This payment feature will first roll out in the United States before it is taken to other places in the world.Though Facebook doesn’t plan to charge any fee for the time being, it can gain a lot if the payment function becomes popular.For one, user stickiness to the social network site may increase.Through the access to users’ debit card and payment information, Facebook can make use of valuable data to offer more targeted advertising services. Considering Facebook Messenger’s huge user base of 700 million accounts, the revenue potential should be promising.But compared with the real-time settlement of Tencent’s Weixin Payment, Facebook’s payment function takes longer to complete the transaction — up to three business days.David Marcus, the vice president of Facebook’s Messenger division admitted that his idea came from Tencent’s online payment and taxi-hailing services.Social platforms’ expansion into payment platforms has become a trend.Martin Lau Chi-ping, president of Tencent, said he is optimistic about the debit card bundle business.Lau revealed that “red packet activity”, a feature that lets users based in China to gift money to friends and family, has prompted many users to bundle their debit cards and credit cards to their Weixin accounts.Weixin Payment has more than 100 million users at the moment, and there is still plenty of room to grow.Medical service could become one of the most important applications. Users can use the Weixin Payment to make appointments with doctors and pay consultation fees afterwards.;p2p/p2b;http://www.ejinsight.com/20150320-facebooks-p2p-payment-service/
230;Snapchat's Snapcash: Is Peer-to-Peer Payment Safe?Do you need to pay a friend back for buying your movie ticket but won't see them for a while? Or maybe you want to send your nephew money for his birthday but fear the check would be lost in the mail? Snapchat has partnered up with Square for a new feature, Snapcash, which allows its users to send and receive money on the app. It's as easy as sending selfies with Snapchat, but how safe is it?How Does Snapcash Work?The first time you use Snapcash, it will prompt you to link a debit card to your account through Square, which means you will automatically become a Square user in the process. You must enter your card number, security code and billing zip code before you can send or receive money. Sending money on Snapchat is similar to sending messages on the app. The recipient will get a notification and must also link a debit card to their Snapcash account in order to receive the money. Once they link their card, the money will be deposited into their account. Unlike regular messages, money transaction messages will not disappear from your chat history in Snapchat. Once you send the cash, the recipient has 24 hours to link their debit card to claim the money. If they fail to do so, the money is refunded to the sender.One of the disadvantages with Snapcash is that there's no way to cancel a transaction after you send it. That means if you send it to the wrong person or send the wrong amount, there's a chance that you may have created a major headache for yourself, especially since you'll have to go through Square to dispute it.Is It Safe?The only security feature that Snapchat has is a setting that requires you to enter your card's security code before each payment. With the history the app has with hackers, this doesn't seem like enough. However, Snapchat claims to only manage the message itself, leaving Square to control the financial aspect. This means Snapchat will not store any of your debit card information, as Square will encrypt it and submit it to their servers.So can you trust Square with your financial information? Square is best known for giving small businesses a way to accept credit cards for payments, via a smartphone swiping device or tablets that function as cash registers (as you've seen on food trucks or in smaller boutiques and stores). While the company does have a long-standing history of securely storing information, it's always best to be skeptical of handing over your financial information.We should also note that since Snapcash requires you to use a debit card instead of credit, you may be more financially vulnerable if Square is ever breached. This is because you'll be vulnerable to someone gaining access to all of your bank accounts connected to the card, instead of just one credit card account. Learn more about why credit is a better option than debit here.What Are the Limitations?Snapcash is currently only available to Snapchat users in the United States, who are at least 18 years old and who have a Visa or Mastercard debit card. There is also a limit on how much money can be sent and received. According to Snapchat, the limit on funds sent can be raised to up to $2,500 per week, and $1,000 per month for funds received.The Snapcash feature is only available for peer-to-peer payments, which means that you cannot use it to make purchases from vendors. There are other options for peer-to-peer payment, like PayPal and the mobile app Venmo, but each has its own drawbacks, with security being the main worry. Most of these peer-to-peer payment apps and services like this store all of your information, so anyone who might gain access to your phone or computer could use your card to send themselves money and take you for everything you've got. Venmo also has a big social component, where it encourages you to share your transaction history in detail -- similar to Facebook's newsfeed, but with payments sent and received between friends. This may not be the type of information you want posted online for anyone to potentially see.Should I Use It?With Snapcash, the money is sent directly to your debit card and deposited in your account, regardless of which bank the other party uses and at no charge on either end. There is no login or password to remember (as long as you stay logged into Snapchat) and no special software required to use the service. But since Square and most of the other payment apps store your information, you may want to download a separate Internet security mobile app for security purposes. Many of these types of apps, such as ESET and BitDefender, offer special security features that make sure the apps you use are safe. BitDefender even has a feature you can activate which will prompt you to enter a PIN each time you access an app like Snapchat, giving you an additional layer of protection since no one can get into the app without the PIN.As with most services online, you should always be wary of adding people you don't know to further protect yourself from identity fraud, and monitor your bank transactions daily. Visit our identity theft protection blog to learn other precautions you can take to protect yourself from identity theft.;p2p/p2b;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nextadvisorcom/snapchats-snapcash-is-pee_b_6272728.html
231;"There's A Massive Opportunity In Peer-To-Peer Payments — Here's Why They Could Be Such Big BusinessMobile peer-to-peer payment apps, which let people send money to one another instantly, are gaining rapid adoption in the U.S. and globally. For example, BI Intelligence estimates Venmo will process $2.5 billion in volume this year.The secret to the success of these apps is that they solve a real problem for users: They give them a way to pay each other when they don't have cash or a check. For example, if you go out to dinner these apps make it easy to pay a friend back for covering the cost of your meal. In fact, among U.S. adults who use P2P payment apps, 49% say they use them for dining-related transactions, according to Nielsen.In a new report from BI Intelligence we size the opportunity for mobile P2P transactions, take a high-level look at a handful of these apps and how they work, what the opportunities are for monetization, and explore how P2P payments could be the bridge to consumer uptake of mobile payments.To access the full report and all our coverage of the payments industry, sign up for a trial.Here are some of the report's key findings: •Globally, the volume of P2P payments is over $1 trillion and only a sliver of those transactions are currently conducted via mobile phones.•We forecast that U.S. transaction volume will reach between $7 and $9 billion in 2014 and provide an exclusive 5-year estimate for volume from 2013-2018 in the report. •While mobile P2P payments are beginning to catch on in the developed world, in many emerging markets they are already popular because people effectively use them as a bank account. •A great case study is Kenyan telecom Safaricom's M-Pesa product, which allows its users to transfer  money to one another via text message. Largely as a result of M-Pesa's success, an impressive 92% of Kenyans say they have used mobile P2P payments. •How to monetize these apps is a question largely left unanswered. But for the time being the goal is to onboard as many users as possible. Like social networks, the world of payments is largely dependent on network effects; the more people that use a product the more valuable it becomes.  The report is full of charts and data that can be downloaded and put to use.In full, the report: •Forecasts transaction volume for mobile P2P payments through 2018 and gives an estimate for the size of global P2P payments. •Explains the value of mobile P2P payments to consumers and why there is such a compelling case for mass adoption. •Profiles ten companies' P2P services that we think are indicative of the breadth of services on offer. •Analyzes the major obstacles that mobile P2P payments face, including interoperability and security risks.

232;"Is This the Twilight of the Paper Check? P2P Payments on the RiseNEW YORK (MainStreet) — The paper check may finally be about to vanish. It’s been a long time coming. In 2012, according to Federal Reserve Bank numbers, we wrote some 20 billion of them. That was down from nearly 40 billion in 2003 - but the 20 billion was such a huge number that few have been willing to predict a quick end of paper checks.  Until now.  The question has been: what’s a better way to settle IOUs? Suddenly a new answer is gaining favor, especially among Millennials. “Young people don’t write checks anymore,"" said Mary Monahan, an executive vice president with Javelin Strategy + Research, which focuses on financial services. ""They are paying with person to person payments apps.”  The other fact is that a greater proportion of the population does not suffer from digital anxiety.“People just are getting a lot more comfortable with mobile payments,” said Jim McKelvey, a co-founder of mobile payments tool Square. He added: “People have to be aware they have this new power, and then it takes time for them to figure out how they want to use it.” The new power McKelvey references simply is the profusion of person to person - p2p - payments apps on mobile phones. There are the traditional players - such as PayPal and Square Cash - and now there are many newer tools such as PayPal owned Venmo, Dwolla, and Snapcash via Snapchat (and powered by Square Cash).  Flashback five years ago, and advocates of p2p payments told stories of four co-workers going out to lunch, one puts the tab on a credit card, and the others - said the advocates - would settle up via p2p once they got back to the office. Just three problems with that scenario. The co-workers did not remember their IOU when they got back in the office bustle. They did not necessarily want to make personal payments using the company computer. And - lastly - p2p just did not take off at all.  That is all now changing, dramatically. A driver is that the mobile phone is with us everywhere and, with a few taps, bills can be paid while sitting in a restaurant eating lunch.  The other driver: “The utility of a network goes up as the network grows,” said James Wester, research director for IDC Financial Insights. That matters because more of us are signed up with p2p services and even more will be since now Facebook - with over one billion users - has announced it will offer p2p in its Messenger app.  PayPal, the granddaddy of p2p, had some 162 million active digital wallets, according to the company. Probably the fastest p2p velocity right now is with Venmo. From essentially a standing start, Venmo claims its 2014 payments volume was $2.4 billion. It adds that Q4 volume was $906 million, up 29% quarter over quarter.  Also, many industry experts believe Apple will soon offer its flavor of p2p. The company offered no comment when asked.  Either way, pretty much everybody you know will soon have some kind of p2p account. How are they using it? In research conducted by communications agency WalkerSands, the primary use cases for p2p were splitting shared expenses such as a lunch tab, a bar bill or a cab fare.  Others see more potential. Steve Shaw, a vice president at financial technology company Fiserv who is involved in the company’s PopMoney p2p offering - available through some 400 financial institutions, said Shaw - pegged the average p2p transaction amount at $400. Obviously the lunch splitting is still occurring but, said Shaw, genuinely big ticket expenses - such as sharing rent - are creeping in and that nudges up the per transaction average.  As for size of the p2p market, 451 Research predicts p2p payments will grow from $2.8 billion in 2014 to $12.9 billion in 2018.  The fact: more of us appear to be discovering just how convenient it is to pay with p2p. More services also are offering free or low cost payments. Venmo, for instance, is free for payments made via many debit cards; Dwolla charges a flat fee of a quarter for transactions of $10 or greater; PayPal is free for friends and families payments made via a bank account.  Case in point of today’s p2p users: Dave Sims, CEO of mortgage portal Floify, who said: “I just got a bill from my lawyer yesterday and am initiating payment to them via Dwolla. They are perfectly happy to accept payment via Dwolla. It's so easy for me: a few mouse clicks, no assembling a check/envelope/stamp, transparency while the funds flow.” Bedford Stuyvesant, Brooklyn landlord Bill Irwin said he has his tenants pay him monthly rent -- $3,000 -- via Venmo. ""It has been very convenient for everyone,” he said.  New York marketing strategist Matthew Hurst said he recently used Venmo to get reimbursed for some two dozen tickets he bought for friends to Medieval Times. “Only a few chose to pay me in cash,” said Hurst. He added: “Using Venmo has become second hand between me and my friends; sometimes they'll even say ‘just send me a bill on Venmo’ when we're paying as a group. A few of my friends prefer using PayPal, but no matter what they're using to pay, it's easier than depositing a check in the bank.” Bet on it. P2p’s rising popularity is writing the obituary for paper checks. Do you know where your checkbook is? And also a stamp? Do you care?

233;How Companies Can Boost Digital Person to Person Payments: Fiserv ExecAs their financial lives have become more digital, consumers have embraced technology like online bill pay and mobile check deposit.Yet when it comes to paying other people most still rely on cash and checks. A 2013 Fiserv survey found that 56% of consumers who exchanged money with another person in the previous 12 months had used cash and 41% had used a check, compared to just 31% who had used on online method. While digital person-to-person (P2P) payments have gained traction in the last few years, particularly among millenials, these services have yet to hit the mainstream. Focusing on four fundamental factors can boost adoption and use of P2P payments: consumer education, a focus on mobile access, faster payment options and improved interconnectivity among existing P2P payment services and other payment networks.Consumer Education. Many consumers have only a passing knowledge of P2P payment services. While they may know that such services exist, they are often unaware that their bank or credit union offers one. There is also a lack of awareness about how P2P services work. Common misperceptions, notably that bank account information is required to make a payment or that only certain people can receive payments, can be tackled with education efforts. Educating financial institution employees to be knowledgeable about P2P offerings, and marketing service availability and benefits, are foundational ways to raise awareness and use.Addressing consumer concerns about security is also important. Proactive communication to consumers about security standards and policies that are in place, as well as reassurance of access to customer care should a concern arise, can give consumers the confidence to use a P2P payment service for the first time. Reiterating that only a name and email address or mobile phone number are needed to send money can also alleviate concerns about sharing personal information.More Mobile Access: As consumers grow more comfortable making transactions using their mobile devices, financial institutions can capture more P2P payments by extending digital P2P payment capabilities to the mobile channel. P2P payments can be integrated into mobile banking so consumers can easily pay other people as the need arises, particularly in face-to-face situations.Mobile access in combination with faster payment speeds, discussed below, has the potential to dramatically boost adoption and use of P2P payments. The Fiserv survey mentioned above found that the single most common way for people to exchange funds is to give someone cash in person, accounting for one-third of all P2P payments. As mobile access becomes the standard and payment times speed up digital P2P payment recipients have the same immediate satisfaction as having cash in their hand, positioning digital P2P payments to replace many of today’s cash-based transactions.Improvements in Speed of Payments: Consumers increasingly expect to be able to make real-time payments. While real-time speed may not be required for every transaction, consumers want to have the option of real-time delivery in specific situations. A “real-time first” mentality, which assumes that real-time is the ultimate standard of delivery, makes sense for digital personal payments. Fiserv research indicates that financial institutions should see a 20 percent higher adoption rate if a real-time, competitively priced P2P payment option is offered in addition to 3-day and next-day delivery options. In addition, consumers have shown that they are willing to pay a reasonable fee for the added convenience and value of having a payment transmitted instantly.Interconnected Networks: Ubiquity is key to successful P2P. Consumers want to be able to send money to anyone they need to without checking to see if they use a specific P2P payment service or bank at a certain financial institution. Many services ensure this ubiquity by offering websites where payment recipients can go to claim money, but this results in more steps for the recipient than there would be if their bank account were directly connected to the P2P payment service, and can delay the delivery of funds.Interconnectivity between strategic P2P payment providers and other payment networks can streamline the user experience and speed payments. Similar to the way that once-proprietary ATM networks have evolved to interconnect with each other, making it possible for a consumer to withdraw cash anywhere in the world, an interconnected approach in which P2P networks connect to each other as well as other payments networks (such as card networks) would boost the reach and speed of P2P payments. Better reach and faster speed boost consumer convenience and value, serving as drivers for consumer adoption and usage.Moving to Mainstream: While the transition from cash and checks to digital P2P payments will not happen overnight, adoption is accelerating as the services mature and consumers grow more familiar with the benefits. Financial institutions and P2P service providers have the opportunity to accelerate this process by educating consumers and promoting the benefits of these services, offering mobile access and faster payment options, and pursuing interconnectivity with other strategic P2P services.;p2p/p2b;http://www.paymentssource.com/news/paythink/how-companies-can-boost-digital-person-to-person-payments-fiserv-exec-3020392-1.html
234;Innovation spotlight: Jiffy – instant mobile payments set for EuropeJiffy, an Italy-based initiative for instant mobile payments, is about to go into full production with 13 participating banks, and already harbours pan-European aspirations.Jiffy is a person-to-person (P2P) payment solution underpinned by technology from Italy-based software house, SIA.Massimo Arrighetti, SIAMassimo Arrighetti, SIAThe offering is fully based on the SEPA Credit Transfers (SCT) standards, so can successfully operate anywhere in Europe, says SIA’s chief executive, Massimo Arrighetti.‘Jiffy is the only pan-European offering using SEPA,’ he states. SIA has been pitching the offering to banks in the Netherlands and Belgium, and has also done a presentation to all European central banks attending a gathering in Basel. ‘The feedback has been very positive’ and the potential is vast, Arrighetti believes. One banking group – Unicredit – is already taking Jiffy across the border, with plans to roll the offering across its Europe-wide network.The beauty of Jiffy is that large banks in Europe can leverage their existing SEPA infrastructures to join the scheme, he explains. ‘All it takes is a few hundred thousand Euros and a couple of months work.’Jiffy was introduced to the Italian market last autumn, at which point nine banks committed to it. The first bank, UBI Banca, piloted the service in November 2014, went into full production in February 2015 and ran it exclusively until June. It was then joined by Intesa Sanpaolo and shortly afterwards another eight banks connected to Jiffy. Arrighetti says that by the end of summer, 13 banks will be live with Jiffy. This means that the service will be available to 85 per cent of current account users in Italy (according to SIA’s statistics, around 40 million people in Italy use digital channels for banking).‘The adoption by consumers has already gone viral, and that is without any advertising as such,’ Arrighetti says.The next step is to move into the person to business (P2B) domain, which is expected to be available by the end of the year. According to Arrighetti, ‘retailers are very interested’.Banks using Jiffy: first-hand experienceAs mentioned earlier, 13 banks in Italy have adopted Jiffy. In addition to the aforementioned banks, these include BancoPosta (the country’s postal bank), Cariparma (a subsidiary of Crédit Agricole group), BNL (member of the BNP Paribas group), Banca Carige, CheBanca!, Banca Mediolanum, Monte Dei Paschi Di Siena, Banca Popolare di Milano (BPM), Banca Popolare di Sondrio and Banca Popolare di Vicenza.IBS has asked a few to share their experiences.Elisabeth Rizzotti, UBI BancaElisabeth Rizzotti, UBI BancaUBI Banca uses the Jiffy service as part of its broader UBI Pay offering, which consists of three key pieces: sending money with Jiffy, paying contactless/NFC, and purchasing online with Masterpass, an e-commerce wallet.UBI Pay is the bank’s ‘first app that revolutionises the payment experience’, says Elisabeth Rizzotti, head of digital channels and communication at UBI Banca. The Jiffy part enables users ‘to send money in real time to contacts in their telephone book, and even contacts not registered with UBI Pay can receive the money by downloading the app in just a few steps in the same time as for an ordinary SCT’.If the recipient is a UBI Pay customer, the money is transferred to their account in real time 24_7. If the contact is not a UBI Pay customer the money will arrive the following working day.There is a ‘small charge’ for the service, says Rizzotti. Customers can either pay for each transaction or opt for a monthly flat rate.The app is available on the iOS, Android and Windows smartphones. ‘In just a few months since its launch, it has been downloaded and used by tens of thousands of customers,’ Rizzotti claims.Intesa Sanpaolo has also integrated the Jiffy offering into its mobile app, ‘as our mobile strategy is to have only one entry point through the customer’s smartphone’, says Massimo Tessitore, head of integrated channels at the bank. ‘The app has a dedicated module for mobile payments, including Jiffy and contactless, we’ve designed this module easy to enter – by using a fast login – to allow speedy, daily purchases.’Massimo Tessitore, Intesa SanpaoloMassimo Tessitore, Intesa SanpaoloHe says the integration of Jiffy was straightforward as the service is web-based. ‘The IT development was completed smoothly,’ he comments. ‘Our efforts have been focused, on the one hand, on the development of an integrated and personalised front-end for an easy user experience, and on the other hand to guarantee our internal level of security.’There is no cost for joining the service, dubbed JiffyPay, at Intesa Sanpaolo. ‘Receiving a P2P payment is always free of charge, sending a P2P payment is free for amounts under €50, as our aim is to help the bank to reduce the costs of cash management,’ Tessitore says. The pricing of transactions above €50 is aligned to the SCT charges.‘We firmly believe that P2P solutions are driven by market needs and consumers’ expectations. This means that, at this point of development, revenues are not the primary goal in marketing a P2P service although both participant banks and SIA aim to build a framework sustainable in terms of costs for all the different parties,’ he concludes.Unicredit has just launched its Jiffy offering for the domestic market and has far-reaching plans for it. ‘We are planning to implement it across our network of 17 countries in Europe,’ says Eugenio Tornaghi, head of global cards and mobile payments, Unicredit. ‘We are also aiming at a cross-border utilisation. Think about remittances, for instance.’The aim is to capture payments that are still done entirely by cash, says Tornaghi, for day-to-day activities like sharing a bill in a restaurant or giving pocket money to children. There will be a charge for clients and the service will be integrated into a payment app that will be ready by Q1 next year. Until then, users have to download and install a specific ‘send money’ app.The implementation of the Jiffy solution at Unicredit did not pose any major problems (‘if not the usual ones’), Tornaghi says. ‘The fact that Jiffy utilises the SCT service, is, in my opinion, the key success factor.‘We consider the implementation in Italy as a footprint, and SIA more a partner than a provider.’Jiffy: how it worksJiffy by SIAJiffy, instant P2P payments service from SIAJiffy is available as an app on Android, iOS and Windows Phone operating systems and is designed to allow real-time P2P (current account to current account) money transfers using SCT standards.The service can be accessed via a standalone app or integrated into the banks’ existing mobile apps. Once a customer is logged in, Jiffy will display their personal contacts list and automatically show which of their contacts are also signed up. The customer then selects the person they would like to send money to, enters the amount and has the option to send a text message, before clicking to complete the transaction.The service has a similar concept to the Whatsapp messaging tool. It also compares to the Paym service, which was set up by the UK Payments Council last year.Jiffy users can also make payments to contacts that do not bank with an institution that recognises Jiffy. This is because the system works with an International Bank Account Number (IBAN), so payments can be made directly to a pre-paid card associated with an account that contains an IBAN.;p2p/p2b;https://ibsintelligence.com/innovation-spotlight-jiffy-instant-mobile-payments-set-for-europe/
235;The Quest To Kill Cash: How Peer-To-Peer Payments Apps Are Improving The Way We PayUsing mobile devices to make peer-to-peer payments may not be a widely used service — yet. But they're poised to take off phenomenally. The service may even pave the way for using your smartphone to pay in-store. A peer-to-peer (P2P) payment is a payment made outside of a formal business context. Paying a babysitter or paying a roommate for your share of the rent are examples. As they stand, peer-to-peer payments aren't as easy as they could be. They are primarily made in cash or with a check, which means they are slow or require making a trip to an ATM or bank. But if you use the Venmo app, for example, to pay your roommate for your share of the rent, you can make the payment instantly whether you're near or far, even if you don't have a check or cash.In a new report from BI Intelligence, we forecast the value of mobile P2P payment services to consumers is so great that they will see a meteoric rise in adoption in the next five years. We explain why businesses are offering mobile P2P services, how fast they are going to take off, and profile 10 companies that are making headway in the space.Access the Full Report By Signing Up For A Free Trial Today >>Here are some of the key takeaways from the report: • Globally, the volume of P2P payments is over $1 trillion and only a sliver of those transactions are currently conducted via mobile phones.• In emerging markets, there is especially huge potential for P2P payments made on cell phones, due to a lack of financial infrastructure. A high proportion of the population in these markets lack access to checking and savings accounts.•Kenyan telecom Safaricom provides an excellent case study for the success of mobile P2P payments  in emerging technology markets. The telecom has a product called M-Pesa, which allows its users to transfer  money to one another via text message. Largely as a result of M-Pesa's success, an impressive 92% of Kenyans say they have used mobile P2P payments.  •In developed markets, adoption of mobile P2P payment services won't be as fast. But we believe they still have real potential in the long-run because these services solve real pain points for consumers. Our high-end estimate is that mobile P2P transactions volume could reach $86 billion in the U.S. by 2018. •Mobile P2P payment services are usually free or next to free to use, which begs the question of how they will be monetized. Different services have experimented with fees and even advertising. But mainly, these services will serve as Trojan horses to gain user trust for mobile-based transactions.  In full, the report: •Forecasts transaction volume for mobile P2P payments through 2018 and gives an estimate for the size of global P2P payments. •Explains the value of mobile P2P payments to consumers and why there is such a compelling case for mass adoption. •Profiles ten companies' P2P services that we think are indicative of the breadth of services on offer. •Analyzes the major obstacles that mobile P2P payments face, including interoperability and security risks. ;p2p/p2b;http://www.businessinsider.com/how-peer-to-peer-payments-apps-are-improving-the-way-we-pay-2014-4?IR=T
236;"Venmo app makes peer-to-peer payments easy NEW YORK -- On a trip to Maine with four friends, Alexander Culbertson racked up $1,300 on gas, hotel rooms, food and drinks.But instead of splitting all of the weekend's activities evenly throughout the trip, one person paid for everything. Then, later they all split the final bill using Venmo, an app that lets users pay with a tap and a text-like message.""It would have been a nightmare for all of us to evenly split every transaction,"" says Culbertson, 26, a Boston advertising executive. ""If you say 'I'll grab beer and you grab the groceries,' things usually don't come out as planned. ""This kept things easy.""Person-to-person mobile payment services like PayPal-owned Venmo are catching on as a way to bypass searching for an ATM or splitting a bill on multiple cards when the dinner check comes. And they're particularly popular among millennials, a generation that seems to have their own way of doing everything.For Dan Callahan, 22, a digital marketing manager in Philadelphia, using Venmo means avoiding the awkward situation of nagging his roommate for rent since you can request payment via the app.""I write the checks or pay online for our rent, utilities, and anything else, and at the end of each month, I total it all up and he sends me half,"" Callahan said. ""And it's all free. Beats having to get ATM charges from my bank and dealing with cash!""The services also are growing quickly: Venmo is seeing four times the growth this quarter as it did last year. The service processed $2.4 billion in transactions in 2014 and $1.3 billion last quarter alone. Similar services abound, including Snapcash on Snapchat and Square's Cashtags which can be used via tweet or text.It's still just a sliver of total spending online -- which Forrester predicts will reach $334 billion in 2015. But the peer-to-peer payment services are catching on with some more quickly than so-called digital wallets like Apple Pay or Samsung Pay.Rohan Gandhi, 24, a consultant in Washington, D.C., said when his friend lost a debit card while traveling with him in Cambodia, he was able to foot all the bills and then be ""Venmo-ed"" back instantly by his traveling companion.""In terms of convenience, us twentysomethings are never without our phones, and the app is incredibly easy to navigate,"" he said.The services link directly to your bank account, debit card, or credit card. (In Venmo's case, it's free to link to your bank account or debit account but credit card transactions cost a 3 percent fee).You first have to connect to other people who have signed up for the service. Then, you type in the amount you want to send someone, add a short message about what the payment is for, and hit send.""I like the convenience of it -- primarily that immediacy,"" said Sierra Davis, 25, a newspaper writer in Los Angeles.Security works the same way it does for any app that stores your bank or card information. That means it might be accessible if someone steals your phone. And the fee for using credit cards discourages their use, even though credit cards are usually fraud-protected for anything over $50, unlike some bank accounts and debit cards.Cynthia Larose, chair of the privacy and security practice at the law firm Mintz Levin in Boston, said users should be cautious.""These days you can't assume that any system is secure,"" she said. ""If you're starting off using a system like this, I wouldn't use your main bank account.""Peer-to-peer services have security policies in place but they're not always as direct as dealing with a bank. Venmo, for example, says users aren't liable for more than $50 of any unauthorized transfers they find, but only if they contact the company within two days after learning of the theft.Still, for Davis, like many, the convenience outweighs security concerns.""Security is always a concern when dealing with finances online. But I bank online, I make online purchases, I've used PayPal in the past without a problem. I have a password on my phone, in addition to the password on the app, and I keep a close eye on my finances and trust my bank,"" she said. ""For my generation, money transfers like this are so familiar that it feels safe.""The messages that go along with the payments are a major attraction for many users. Venmo features a Twitter-like newsfeed that shows who your friends are paying and what they're paying for.""I like how you can leave notes saying exactly what the transaction was for,"" said Jordyn Holman, 21, from Chicago. ""People are fun with describing it, oftentimes using emojis like hamburgers and drinks to describe a meal that was Venmo-ed.""Peer-to-peer systems typically work only for people who are on the same system, and multiple systems have sprung up. Facebook recently jumped in the game with Facebook mobile payments, Square and PayPal have built up their own services, and banks have their own person-to-person, or P2P, servicesThe services, which are free or charge a nominal fee, don't make much money. PayPal's soon-to-be CEO Dan Schulman said the goal for Venmo is to eventually tie the app into PayPal's network of merchants and have more businesses accept Venmo. Currently, Papa John's accepts Venmo payments for Pizza and HBO accepted it for its pay-per-view blockbuster boxing match between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao in May.Adam Madaris, 22, a bank teller in Boulder, Colorado, hosted a party with his roommate for the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight and had attendees split $99 pay-per-view cost via Venmo.""I actually can't think of a single one of my friends who haven't used a service for making payments electronically, whether that's Venmo, Snapcash, Google wallets, or even my bank's P2P service,"" he said.";p2p/p2b;http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20150627/business/150629278/

238;CU24 Broadens Real Time P2P Payment ServiceCU24 will offer its POCKET2POCKET real time P2P payment service on CU Mobile Apps from Member Service Solutions LLC.The Tallahassee, Fla.-based payments network launched POCKET2POCKET in February, 2014. The partnership with Franklin, Tenn. based Member Service Solutions LLC will increase the number of users.The originator of the transaction will have to be member of a CU24  participating credit union, according to both companies.The way it works is the user opens the credit union app, clicks on P2P, identifies the person they wish to pay, their cell number and the dollar amount, and then hits send, said Tom Gray, CU Mobile Apps partner.According to CU24, the receiving party would not have to enroll to receive the funds. Instead, depending on what information the originator supplied, the receiver will receive an email or text message that they received the funds and then enter their debit card number or account number.Further, the pin pad where users enter the information will scramble it as they enter the numbers, CU24 said.POCKET2POCKET is an advanced real-time EFT solution, rather than the traditional  automated clearing house-based method that can delay funds transfer by anywhere from 24 to 72 hours, according to CU24.;p2p/p2b;http://www.cutimes.com/2014/07/24/cu24-broadens-real-time-p2p-payment-service
239;FirstBank Adds Person-to-Person Payment System to Its Powerful Mobile Banking AppPHOENIX--(BUSINESS WIRE)--FirstBank Holding Company, the highly successful bank with 15 branches in the Phoenix area, today announced a person-to-person (P2P) payments system as the newest tool in its robust mobile banking application. With this addition, FirstBank becomes the most recent bank to offer P2P payments through the clearXchange network, providing customers with an easy way to send and receive money via their mobile devices. FirstBank is the fourth member of the clearXchange network and will be going live today. It is the first regional bank in the nation to go live with the service. “Joining the clearXchange network gives our customers a reliable, convenient and secure way to send and receive money”Tweet thisclearXchange is the largest P2P payments network in the U.S. created by and for financial institutions, and the country’s leading banks rely on clearXchange's financial technology to allow consumers and businesses to send and receive money using just an email or mobile number. More than 100 million people already have access to the clearXchange network directly through their current bank. The addition of clearXchange allows FirstBank customers to send payments from their existing FirstBank account safely and conveniently using only the recipient’s mobile number or e-mail address, and without providing sensitive account information. Customers of participating banks can easily transfer and receive money using their existing online or mobile banking service. Others whose bank is not yet part of the clearXchange network, only need to do a one-time registration at clearXchange.com to receive payments directly to their account at any U.S. bank. “Joining the clearXchange network gives our customers a reliable, convenient and secure way to send and receive money,” said Jim Reuter, executive vice president at FirstBank. “We’re excited to continuously provide innovative services to our customers and enhance the flexibility of banking with FirstBank.” Mike Kennedy, CEO of clearXchange, adds, “With clearXchange, FirstBank provides customers with a seamless and secure person-to-person payments solution, making it easier to send money to family and friends. We are excited to add FirstBank’s customers to our national network.” Since opening its first Arizona location in 2007, FirstBank has provided area residents and businesses with more than 2,025 loans worth more than $750 million. FirstBank is highly active with local communities where its employees live and work. The company donated more than $5 million to nonprofits in Arizona, California and Colorado last year and was the main sponsor of the inaugural Arizona Gives Day, a 24-hour online giving initiative aimed at increasing individual giving throughout the state, which raised more than $1 million for Arizona non-profits. How clearXchange works For banking customers, clearXchange enables P2P payments directly from a user’s existing deposit account through their bank’s online and mobile platforms. Customers do not need to open a new account or conduct financial transactions via a third-party service to transfer funds. Instead of difficult to remember account numbers, customers use their email or mobile number. When receiving a payment, funds are directly deposited into the user’s bank account. What’s more, customers get all the services and protections that they get today from their banks. For banks and credit unions, clearXchange is a compelling P2P network that easily integrates into online and mobile platforms. The financial institution continues to drive and maintain its own customer relationships and remains the center of their customers’ financial lives. Enrolled customers conduct transactions on the bank’s sites and receive support from their bank regardless of where a transaction is initiated. ;p2p/p2b;http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20141212005053/en/FirstBank-Adds-Person-to-Person-Payment-System-Powerful-Mobile
240;Payments revolution? Forget Apple – watch AfricaAs the global payments industry transforms to take advantage of new technologies, some services offer the prospect of real change, but others are simply hype. Telling the difference will be the key to success in the next five years, according to speakers at the HPS PowerCard conference in Marrakesh last week.“People don’t care about getting 10 cents off their next Starbucks,” said John Chaplin, chairman at Helios Investment Partners. “I have yet to see anything that works better than a card in face to face transactions. Here in Africa, payments innovation is not just about mobile money, it’s about the way lending is done and deposits are handled. We are seeing some fantastic innovation and that is feeding back into the rest of the world.”Chaplin is the founder of an organisation called the Global Payments Innovation Jury, which has been meeting biannually since 2007. The non-profit organisation consists of a panel of 40 judges, all of them serving chief executives at financial services companies. They pool their experiences to work out the trends affecting the payments industry and attempt to sift through what is hype and what is significant.According to the Jury’s 2015 report, the most innovative region in payments at the moment is Asia, followed by Africa. Europe falls into last place, while North and South America are in the middle. Chaplin believes that part of the reason for these scores is that much of the innovation being generated in North America consists of “solutions in search of a problem which doesn’t exist”, and are therefore not particularly relevant to the rest of the world.“If you try to make a P2P payment in the US you will wait many days – it just doesn’t work efficiently in many places,” said John Chaplin, chairman at Helios Investment Partners. “What we really need is an efficient real-time payment system.”Despite praising the card in face to face transactions, Chaplin did accept that virtual money and mobile accounts are better than physical cards in terms of the cost of providing the service, since virtual accounts are “almost free” to create. However, he warned that providing digital accounts to unbanked consumers would take more than simply repackaging existing bank offerings such as a plastic card-based service and porting it over into the digital world.“You need to really embrace what digital can do,” he said. While many financial institutions are focusing on reaching the unbanked and spreading financial inclusion, the industry might also do well to look again at cross-border remittances, he added. “Despite all the innovations in remittances, they are still expensive and slow. Yet newer, low price challengers like World Remit and others are starting to chew away at the most profitable business areas of older players such as Western Union.”Disintermediation has been discussed a lot in recent years, but new entrants can sometimes be as much a danger to each other as the existing financial system. The challenges of getting it right were highlighted by the 18 different mobile money operators that exist in Nigeria alone. According to Chaplin, “none of them are making money” – in fact, there are only five mobile money providers worldwide that make a profit, he later told Banking Technology. The only way these providers can thrive would be through interoperability, since at present there are simply too many players to be profitable when each is duplicating the same infrastructure.Some players may stand to gain and others lose, according to the Jury’s report. For example, it highlighted alternatives to Visa or MasterCard, such as domestic payment schemes where available, which can in some cases process transactions at a quarter of the cost of the international card schemes. For example, in Ghana the Ghana Inter-Bank Bank Payment System is a domestic processor that was sert up to encourage consumers and businesses to keep their funds in the Ghanaian banking system rather than having it abroad. Part of the impetus for that scheme is the concept of ensuring customers do not have to pay using cash, which is seen as a relatively expensive way of making payments for the country.“We are migrating all domestic transactions to electronic payment,” said Archie Hesse, chief executive at Ghipps Ghana. “If you compare cash to cards, it’s very expensive. The government pays a huge amount of money for currency, and because of the brand on the cards, they also pay to the international providers – even individuals are burdened. The international card schemes are about five times the cost of the domestic scheme. For us, it’s a no-brainer to encourage the use of our domestic scheme.”Much of the emphasis of the report was on telling the difference between hype generated by developments such as Bitcoin, and on technologies or services that can make a significant difference to banks and consumers. For example, the Jury’s survey found that 85% of respondents felt that crypto-currencies are not a serious alternative to fiat currencies backed by central banks.“For me, the fact that only 13% think it will happen in the next five years raises big questions about whether it will ever happen,” said Chaplin. “It’s unregulated, and it will have to become regulated for it to work – but once it is regulated, that takes away a lot of the appeal. The fact that some regulators see it as the work of Satan is also a problem.”Instead, he suggested, the Blockchain concept behind Bitcoin will be the most significant development to come out of the whole story, because it provides a distributed ledger that can be useful to banks. Commonwealth Bank of Australia recently signed up to Ripple, which uses blockchain technology.However, the most over-hyped area in global payments by a large margin is Apple Pay, according to the report. “There is a huge gap between what is being claimed for Apple Pay and what it can actually deliver. It’s not that fundamental. It’s not bad, it can do interesting things, but don’t be swayed by people claiming it is the most important thing ever to happen in the history of payments. It isn’t.”;p2p/p2b;http://www.bankingtech.com/300551/payments-revolution-forget-apple-watch-africa/
241;Amazon Wants To Include Peer-to-Peer Payments In Its “Real World” PayPal CompetitorEarlier today, the WSJ published a report on how Amazon is building a Kindle-based point-of-sale payments service for local merchants using technology it picked up via its Gopago acquisition –something we actually reported on back in December. In fact, this looks like just part of what Amazon has in mind. The e-commerce giant is also developing a solution for person-to-person payments — bypassing banks and other payment networks — putting it in even closer competition with P2P payment giant PayPal.The P2P payment system, as it’s being conceived, would have a mobile component to it, and it would be cloud-based, so presumably usable over desktop, too.Those Amazon phones we and others keep talking about could be coming soon — the latest that we’ve heard, by the way, is that they may get announced in the next 60 days and ship this summer. Building in a P2P service to sweeten the deal, and help differentiate the phones from the rest of the pack, could be a smart move.Amazon describes the P2P solution as being part of a bigger strategy to build “products and services which will delight billions of customers as they buy and sell things in the real world.”The company is currently looking to hire a number of developers for new payments services beyond those that it already offers online, through its own site and now on other sites. Some of the roles specifically are to develop products that will extend Amazon’s reach “from e-commerce to commerce in general”, and some are specified to work on products for local commerce.One of the ads, for a position as a Senior Technical Program Manager in San Francisco (there is another, identical role in Seattle) is for someone to build a P2P payment product. It reads like this:Our team is charged with extending Amazon’s value proposition (price, selection, and convenience) from e-commerce to commerce in general. We are building products and services which will delight billions of customers as they buy and sell things in the real world (as opposed to online). One of these products is person-to-person (P2P) payments.As part of this ambitious new initiative we need experienced Senior Technical Program Managers to help us deliver a set of innovative mobile and cloud based products. The customer experiences we are building are powered by secure, scalable, and highly available cloud services.You will work with multiple technical teams to deliver solutions, and will be the driving force that orchestrates all the moving pieces as needed to ensure successful and on-time delivery.If you are focused on delivering exceptional products and services that provide exceptional value to end customers, and like to be part of team that likes to have fun… JOIN US!Among the qualifications, applicants are requested to have computer science backgrounds, seven or more years of software engineering experience, mobile app experience, as well as evidence of having cut teeth  product delivery and startup experience. There are a few reasons why it makes sense for Amazon to build a P2P payment platform. For starters, in a side-by-side feature war with PayPal, offering a solution to enable people to send each other money — the basic service that got PayPal started — would be an essential product for Amazon if it hopes to win business away from eBay’s payment leviathan. And PayPal is not the only one playing here. There is also Square with its Cash service and, just earlier today, Ribbon.)Why match the features? Because making a payments platform as ubiquitous as possible makes it also more convenient. In payments, I can’t help but think that the solution that will be the most seamless to use will be the one that wins out. It’s the reason why so many mobile payments services have been such a flop: they’re just simply not as good as what is already in place, between cards and good old fashioned cash.Apart from enhancing Amazon’s overall position in payments, and adding another mobile payment service into the mix, a P2P service would be useful for Amazon on a number of levels.Developing worldAs Amazon has grown, it’s been building out business into developing markets, where there are still a high proportion of “unbanked” consumers — that is, people without financial profiles in the forms of current accounts or credit histories. Creating a P2P framework is one way that Amazon can start to become a bank for these people and potentially bring them into Amazon as would-be customers. One person can transfer money into another person’s Amazon account. That money can then be cashed out, or it can be used to buy goods on… Amazon.Of course, such a solution could also be applied in developed markets, too. Think here of parents topping up their kids’ allowance, in the form of an Amazon accounts, which can be used to buy books, for example.Small merchant relationshipsWhile a point-of-sale solution would help Amazon expand its relationship with merchants who sell in physical stores, a P2P solution could be used to bolster relationships with even smaller vendors who could use it to make and accept payments. This potentially expands the kinds of sellers that might appear in Amazon’s marketplaces, not just for goods but professional services, too, perhaps as a micro complement what it already offers with its Flexible Payments Service for developers.We’ve reached out to Amazon for comment and will update this post as we learn more.;p2p/p2b;http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/29/amazon-wants-to-include-peer-to-peer-payments-in-its-real-world-paypal-competitor/

244;P2P Payments Player TransferWise Picks-Up $58MTransferWise has snagged a big pile of investment dollars in a round led by one of the Facebook’s earliest backers, Andreessen Horowitz.  The UK-based P2P money transfer startup  and Facebook have reportedly been in talks that would see TransferWise provide remittance services for the social networking giant.The latest $58 million Series C round also saw participation from previous backers Sir Richard Branson, Peter Thiel’s Valar Ventures, Index Ventures, IA Ventures, and Seedcamp.The brainchild of an ex-Skype and PayPal engineer, the goal of the service is simply to make it easier and cheaper to transfer pounds to euros and back.  With the new infusion of cash, TransferWise says  is looking to push global expansion.  To that end, a U.S. office will open next month and outposts in Austria and Germany are in the works for the next few months.The service is also looking to add 300 new currency routes, more than doubling the existing 292 it already operates.It is not known if the massive push outward is to help a potentially upcoming partnership with FB that could require such a scale. “We don’t have anything further to say on Facebook at the moment,” a spokesperson told Tech Crunch.The funding will aid TransferWise’s efforts as it squares off with some very established competition  like PayPal and traditional banks offering money transfer services.  They also face a growing roster of start-ups like Azimo, CurrencyFair and peerTransfer specifically in the area of P2P money transfer. Like TransferWise, Azimo and CurrencyFair are based out of Europe (London and Dublin, respectively) while peerTransfer is based in Boston.“Andreessen Horowitz’s interest in TransferWise shows how ripe financial services are for disruption,” said Taavet Hinrikus, co-founder and CEO, in a statement. “For too long legacy providers’ dominance of the market has allowed consumers to be hoodwinked into paying huge hidden charges for services as basic as currency exchange.” The company is one of the fastest expanding in their vertical, with $4.5 billion having already been transferred through the platform.  As of last April, the start-up was just past the $1 billion mark in transferred funds.As part of the deal, Ben Horowitz will be joining TransferWise’s board. “We are thrilled to be backing Taavet and Kristo. They discovered an important secret and are are uniquely prepared to pursue it,” Horowitz said in a statement on the investment. “Not only is their solution 10 times better than the old way of exchanging foreign currency, but it could not have come at a better time. Since there has been little to no innovation from the traditional banking sector, we see massive opportunity for new financial institutions like TransferWise.”The news of the funding follows reports in fall 2014 that the P2P start-up was raising a round of $50 million at a valuation of $1 billion.  The company offered TC no comment on their valuation.  TransferWise has raised $91 million to date.;p2p/p2b;http://www.pymnts.com/news/2015/p2p-payments-player-transferwise-picks-up-58m/

246;"Apple is doubling down on payments, but it may actually be about authentication.The Cupertino, Calif.-based tech giant is expected to launch a peer-to-peer money transfer service sometime in 2016, according to a report this week from the Wall Street Journal. Apple is no stranger to P2P ? it filed a patent application in January 2013 for a P2P service based on iTunes accounts. Those millions of cards on file are now easily accessible via Apple Pay and TouchID, but the delivery system is more likely to be text messages, or even Apple's own iMessage platform, according to Quartz.It's not known if Apple will make any money off this, but the motive is said to be increasing control over how iPhone users move their money and increasing interest in Apple Pay among millennials. The service could hook into clearXchange, already offered (and now owned through Early Warning) by many of the nation's top banks.Early Warning is a fraud expert, and a vote of confidence for TouchID could go a long way toward increasing use of TouchID in mobile banking. (Bank of America was rumored to be exploring TouchID in mid-2014, but the bank denied the report.) Oren Levy, founder of the payment platform Zooz, commented to Bank Innovation, ""One of the key issues with P2P payments is the fraud and AML implications.

248;Apple’s P2P Service Could Be a Play to Win Banks Over to TouchID Apple is doubling down on payments, but it may actually be about authentication.The Cupertino, Calif.-based tech giant is expected to launch a peer-to-peer money transfer service sometime in 2016, according to a report this week from the Wall Street Journal. Apple is no stranger to P2P — it filed a patent application in January 2013 for a P2P service based on iTunes accounts. Those millions of cards on file are now easily accessible via Apple Pay and TouchID, but the delivery system is more likely to be text messages, or even Apple’s own iMessage platform, according to Quartz.It’s not known if Apple will make any money off this, but the motive is said to be increasing control over how iPhone users move their money and increasing interest in Apple Pay among millennials. The service could hook into clearXchange, already offered (and now owned through Early Warning) by many of the nation’s top banks.Early Warning is a fraud expert, and a vote of confidence for TouchID could go a long way toward increasing use of TouchID in mobile banking. (Bank of America was rumored to be exploring TouchID in mid-2014, but the bank denied the report.) Oren Levy, founder of the payment platform Zooz, commented to Bank Innovation, “One of the key issues with P2P payments is the fraud and AML implications. Apple knows a lot about each customer and uses a fingerprint to verify the user is indeed who he says he is. [Apple] could make P2P much simpler, quicker, and most probably safer.”It seems hard to fathom that Apple’s P2P play could approach the scale or popularity of Venmo, or Facebook Messenger.

250;Top 20 Finance Apps: Google Wallet Still Tops Android Pay Google Wallet is still “money” — but that’s hardly encouraging news for mobile payments at the point of sale.A month and a half or so into the life of Android Pay, Google Wallet, now essentially a peer-to-peer payment app, is still more popular. It’s called Google Wallet (New) in Google Play because Google Wallet (Old) became Android Pay. The enduring popularity of Venmo and Square Cash on both iOS and Android is also notable — P2P is popular. Still, Android Pay being the tenth most downloaded finance app is not too shabby. Apple Pay is not app-based — maybe it would do better if it was. the app is reported to have just 1.4% iOS user penetration.On the iOS side, Stash Invest, which launched in August and updated its app to v. 1.0.1 on Oct. 29, was a surprise at #14. Stash allows users to buy fractional shares of stocks for as little as $5 per transaction. A surprise on the Android side was MileIQ, a mileage tracking app to help with IRS-compliant expense accounts, at #16.Chase Mobile retains the overall top spot in the iOS Store for finance apps, while Credit Karma rules on the Android side.Top 20 rankings are below.

251;Early Warning Appears Set to Relaunch clearXchange as SecureExchange Early Warning, the bank security consortium that last month combined with clearXchange, appears set to relaunch its payments service as SecureExchange.ClearXchange is the stuttering P2P payments network launched by several major banks, including Bank of America and Capital One Financial Corp., in 2011. Bank of America, for example, went live with the service in 2012.When the banks combined Early Warning and clearXchange late last month, they said they did so “to further ensure that our customers can send money, confidently, securely, and in real-time via their financial institutions.” The Early Warning and clearXchange — presumably now called SecureExchange — venture is purportedly “open to all banks and credit unions, of any size … [and] will also meet the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s vision of consumer protection in new faster payment systems.”Despite this, Bank Innovation could not confirm how SecureExchange will differ from clearXchange. No officially release date for the new SecureExchange has been set.;p2p/p2b;http://bankinnovation.net/2015/11/early-warning-appears-set-to-relaunch-clearxchange-as-secureexchange/
252;Does Google Wallet’s P2P Pivot Matter? Android Pay, which begins rolling out today, has not killed Google Wallet as many assumed it would.Instead, Google Wallet today made public that it has made another pivot, this time into a peer-to-peer payments service like PayPal or Square Cash. Several years ago, Google Wallet was the next big thing in mobile payments, but its functionality and prestige suffered from a series of blows that led to the introduction of a prepaid debit card, which still survives.Essentially, the old Google Wallet split into Android Pay, the NFC payment vehicle, and this new, slimmer service. That old Google Wallet app will reportedly be renamed Android Pay soon. Users can send money from a card or bank account or their Google Wallet balance to another users via the app, website, or Gmail. This last service caused a huge stir in the spring of 2013. Gmail users needed to get Google Wallet accounts to use the service, though it’s not clear how successful that drive was. (We are betting it wasn’t.)Why keep Google Wallet alive as a brand rather than fold it into Android Pay? The term “Wallet” hardly seems applicable anymore. Twitter user Frank Young, a former Googler, notes that the option to move funds from Google Wallet to a debit card has expanded its functionality in a significant way:New #GoogleWallet option to cash out to a debit card. This 1 change shifts GOOG's P2P strategy from product to platform.;p2p/p2b;http://bankinnovation.net/2015/09/does-it-matter-that-google-wallet-is-morphing-into-a-p2p-service/
253;Facebook Provides P2P Payments Facebook is joining in on the person-to-person payments game – a venture that banks could actually leverage for their own customers.The social media giant in March announced that it was slowly rolling out a new feature within its “Messenger” app that allows users to send or receive money between friends for free. Users start a message with one of their friends, tap the “$” icon, enter the amount they want to send, tap “Pay” in the top right and add their Visa or MasterCard debit card information to send money. To receive money, users open the conversation from one of their friends, and if it’s the first time they are receiving money, they tap “Add Card” in the message, add their debit card to accept money and the money is transferred. Depending on their bank, the money will be available to them in one to three business days.Facebook stresses that the new feature is secure, as the site encrypts the connection between users and Facebook, as well as their debit card information when users request the site to store it. Moreover, a team of anti-fraud specialists monitor for suspicious purchase activity to help keep accounts safe, the company asserts.Interestingly, the goal is not to become a leading payments processor, but to make Facebook even more attractive so users will potentially buy more products and services from its advertisers.“We’re not building a payments business here,” Facebook’s product manager on the feature Steve Davis told Tech Crunch after the March launch. Instead, Davis said the goal is to offer P2P payments for free to make Messenger “more useful, expressive and delightful.”“Since Facebook makes so much money on ads, $3.59 billion in Q4, it doesn’t have to monetize payments directly,” Tech Crunch wrote. “Facebook just needs to keep people locked into its platform and seeing Newsfeed ads by making Messenger as helpful as possible.”Indeed, if the payment system succeeds, analysts contend that Facebook would extend it to other types of purchases, such as consumers’ buying of products directly from advertisers, according to a March New York Times article.“Facebook could use this as a back door to get people’s debit cards to enable the buy button,” SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Robert Peck told the NYT.Facebook’s entry into this space represents the massively growing digital payment opportunities for the end user. Different types of users will opt for different types of payment methods, and some players offer greater flexibility in addition to P2P payments. Google Wallet charges a 2.9% fee for users to add money from their debit cards, PayPal charges 2.9% plus 30 cents of the amount sent, and Venmo, a mobile payments app owned by PayPal, charges 3% if using a credit card.While Facebook’s initial foray into P2P payments is via Messenger, the company’s strategic vision could reveal a move to using payments across the site directly helping advertisers. But its venture can also spell opportunity for banks wanting to participate in digital payments without having to invest in their own apps: banks can offer direct access to Facebook’s apps, as well as the apps of any other social media sites to join in on the game, such as Pinterest. Banks can choose to either keep the fees or suspend the fees and create greater brand usage with customers.With Facebook’s new venture, banks can impress their customers and go beyond the usually expected forms of convenience – they can give their customers greater flexibility with mobile payments without having to offer their own P2P payments app.;p2p/p2b;http://bankinnovation.net/2015/08/facebook-provides-p2p-payments/
254;P2P Comes to Wearables with Square Cash for the Apple Watch Peer-to-peer payments have arrived on wearable devices with the arrival today of Square Cash for the Apple Watch.The service, with offers a simple numerical keyboard on smartphones, employs a dollar-bill layout on the watch, as seen here. Users tap bills until the correct amount is reached, similar to CIBC’s funds transfer app introduced last May. This is an interesting solution, as a keyboard would likely fit on the screen, but the bill-based entry may be easier for tapping fingers.The app also allows exchanging funds with nearby devices using Bluetooth. Funds can be accepted with a simple tap.Square continues to build delightful apps for consumers, while its true customer base remains merchants. There is a Square Cash for Business, which allows merchants to request payments via Apple Watch for a 1.9% fee.Jack Dorsey, Square’s co-founder and CEO, remains at the helm at Square, despite also taking over as interim CEO role at Twitter, which he co-founded. Square was launched in 2009 and now processes over $30 billion annually.;p2p/p2b;http://bankinnovation.net/2015/08/p2p-comes-to-wearables-with-square-cash-for-the-apple-watch/
255;MasterCard Launches P2P Product — as PayPal Preps IPO MasterCard is not shy about challenging innovative incumbents — after all, it launched Simplify Commerce in June 2013 to compete with both Stripe and Square.Today it introduced MasterCard Send, a P2P solution seemingly targeting businesses and governments — “seemingly” because the page for the service, at press time, was down.[UPDATE: Here is the correct link for the page, sent by MasterCard.]But enough details can be gleaned from the video below and infographic to make it clear the company has PayPal, and perhaps the wider P2P/remittances/disbursements in its sights. It is explicitly taking on “slow, costly checks and Automated Clearing House transactions” — but not credit card payments, apparently.That this is being launched just as PayPal preps its initial public offering makes it all the more startling. Granted, MasterCard no doubt had considered a P2P payment platform for, well, as long as PayPal has been around, but still. It joins Visa in offering P2P functionality. Fortune reports Berkshire Hathaway Travel Protection and FreeShipping.com as being among the first customers of Send.PayPal’s IPO is expected in the third quarter.;p2p/p2b;http://bankinnovation.net/2015/05/mastercard-launches-p2p-product-as-paypal-preps-ipo/
256;Square Cash Opens to Businesses, Introducing $Cashtags [Video] Just days after Facebook sent shock waves through the peer-to-peer payments world, Square announced $cashtags, simple addresses that will allow individuals, and now businesses, to accept payments.In a way, today’s announcement continues Square’s suite of services for businesses, but it is also likely another move to get cards on files, a game of scale in which it considerably trails Apple, Facebook, and Amazon.Square Cash for businesses is called Cash Pro. Merchants are not limited in the amount of money they can transact, but will pay Square a 1.5% fee for accepting payments. This is cheaper than accepting a PayPal payment and Square’s own 2.75% for card transactions, but businesses can cut better deals with the credit card networks, and Facebook could potentially undercut it with a 0% fee down the road.Payments guru Brian Roemmele speculates that Facebook is headed down this path. The micro merchant space, the seeming target of this initiative, is one where Square has considerable experience, although the company has had some difficulty growing out of it.Square is also said to believe the service will appeal to not-for-profits. One of the early users of Cashtags that Square is promoting is $wikipedia.Cashtags allow users to disassociate payments from personally identifying information. This could widen the pool of Square Cash, so instead of exchanging money with just friends, you can pay the guy selling balloons in the park while keeping your information, even your email address, private. Maybe you ARE the guy selling balloons in the park. (If so, please note that the cashtag $balloonguy was still available at cash.me at presstime.)Where does all this leave Square? Square Cash is described by some payments insiders as a money pit for Square, and the last and largest remaining distraction from focusing on its core business of serving small merchants. Its service is perhaps the easiest and cleanest of any out there, but with Facebook and Apple bearing down on them, driven by massive scale, the smoothest UX could quickly become an also-ran. Cashtag or not.;p2p/p2b;http://bankinnovation.net/2015/03/square-cash-opens-to-businesses-introducing-cashtags-video/
257;Venmo to Add ‘Pay With’ Feature, Targets Mobile E-CommerceSoon, it will pay to use Venmo.Specifically, the subsidiary payment service owned by Braintree will soon release “Pay With Venmo,” a service that will let users pay for stuff with money held on their account by Venmo. Sources said the feature is already in development and will be released “soon,” Bank Innovation learned.“Pay With Venmo” would be similar to the existing “Pay With PayPal” feature already implemented by PayPal, which owns Braintree, Venmo’s parent. “Pay With PayPal” lets users purchase goods by withdrawing funds from a user’s PayPal account, as opposed to withdrawing from a user’s bank account.No comment from Venmo.If PayPal and Venmo sound similar, it is because they are. The difference is that Venmo is geared towards millennials and adds a social feed where you could see the transactions of friends and other Venmo users. The app has seen steep growth over the past few months — Business Insider estimates that Venmo is already processing over $1 billion in volume annually.To date, Venmo has been primarily a social P2P payments company, but added Venmo Touch and Venmo Button recently. Touch allows users to store their credit card information (yes, Visa Checkout is basically the same thing), while Button is a web plugin that facilitates tips and donations via Venmo.With “Pay With Venmo,” Venmo apparently wants to capture some of the e-commerce market that PayPal doesn’t have, specifically in the key 18-35 demographic. Similarly, we can see “Pay With” as offering the potential for more in-app purchase volume for Venmo, especially since the company has always pursued a mobile-first strategy and Venmo users are already comfortable with mobile transactions.;p2p/p2b;http://bankinnovation.net/2014/08/venmo-to-add-pay-with-feature-targets-mobile-e-commerce/
258;ByeWallet Tests Collaborative Purchases Can’t afford that hot new thing? Ask a friend to pitch in.ByeWallet is a Spanish startup that brings a social element into payments with collaborative purchases. There are few details yet, but it seems the app will present users with offers based on their spending patterns. A card from a bank account is linked in order for ByeWallet to view the data.Purchases can also lead to prizes for the user — or group of users — that made the payment. A person-to-person payment platform, with a Venmo-like messaging system attached, is also part of the app.Users can request invitations to the service, which is still in beta;p2p/p2b;http://bankinnovation.net/2014/06/video-byewallet-tests-collaborative-purchases/
259;Venmo Adds Feature as It Enjoys Rapid Growth Venmo, the mobile payments startup, continues to add new features that can pad its revenue stream. Venmo, a subsidiary of BrainTree, which is owned by PayPal, allows for peer-to-peer payments that can link with existing social media accounts, like Facebook and Twitter. Users see a real-time feed of their transactions via their social media networks.The new feature Venmo today added allows users to send money by just clicking on a button, which can be set up using embeddable code. Aptly named the “Venmo Button,” the new embeddable feature is installed on a website by copying and pasting code.In a blog post, Venmo envisioned that artists and charitable organizations using the feature to have fans or supporters send them money and donations. Venmo acknowledges that not everyone has a personal website, and that the company is working with websites — presumably social media sites like Facebook — to expand the reach of the new Venmo Button.We’ve reached out to Venmo to see what the company’s plans are regarding future uses of the Venmo Button and will update this post accordingly when we hear back.For now, Venmo has partnered with Gittip, a crowdfunding website geared towards the tech community, to promote the Venmo Button. Gittip specializes in recurring donations towards tech projects and volunteer programs, but Venmo also offers one time donations for its users as well.Venmo, a popular mobile payments app, has been referred to as “the best social network nobody’s talking about,” according to The Wire.The feature is just one way Venmo is trying to expand and create new revenue streams. The company and its parent company BrainTree, which bought Venmo in 2012 for $26 million, has been growing at a rapid rate over the past few months. (BrainTree was bought by PayPal in September 2013 for $800 million in cash.) In a blog post earlier this month, BrainTree CEO Bill Ready said the mobile payments company’s payment volume grew in the last quarter almost 25%, a hefty growth rate, while Venmo’s grew nearly 62% and is now handling $1 billion of payments annually. By providing payments services to companies like AirBnb, Uber, and Fab, BrainTree has been able to grow its business at a rapid rate. Business Insider notes that Venmo has also been making mobile peer-to-peer payments immensely popular, especially on college campuses.The value of Venmo and BrainTree tp PayPal appears to be expanding. EBay CEO John Donahoe even mentioned Venmo in a recent earnings call (eBay owns PayPal), cementing Venmo’s position as a key player for the company. We’re keeping an eye out for Venmo to compete more aggressively with companies like Square and, er, PayPal.;p2p/p2b;http://bankinnovation.net/2014/05/venmo-adds-feature-as-it-enjoys-rapid-growth/
260;Walmart Enters P2P Space American consumers may not go to bank branches all that often, but they sure go to Walmart. 80% of Americans are said to shop at Walmart at least once a year.America’s largest retailer debuted a service called Walmart-2-Walmart last week that allows customers to send money to other customers using the store’s network of more than 4,0o0 retail locations.These person-to-person payments are ordinarily a feature of digital banking services, and see their fullest use case in Africa, where M-Pesa and similar services allow for near-frictionless movement of money through mobile phone carriers. M-Pesa users can use the cash digitally fro their phones or pick up cash at agencies that partner with the service.After the announcement, some observers wondered if the US-only aspect of the service would limit its utility, but Walmart seems to be looking to the large population of customers with limited bank relationships to drive usage rather than to the international remittances market. (Walmart does have a large non-US footprint that it could potentially extend the service to later.) Transfers up to $50 cost $4.50, and transfers up the limit, $900, cost $9.50.Transfers can be funded by debit cards or cash. While talk of money transfers brings Western Union to mind, cash use brings up other potential competitors, such as PayNearMe. This service allows cash-dependent customers to pay bills at retail locations such as 7-Eleven and Family Dollar. Walmart’s service may pose a threat to PayNearMe, given the store’s enormous customer base.Walmart already offers extensive financial services to its customers, including check cashing and bill payment, and a host of banklike services including a mobile app and check writing through its Bluebird prepaid card, issued in partnership with American Express. Walmart also offers the Walmart Money card, a prepaid card that also has a mobile app attached. Walmart also offered a special cash payment service that allows purchases on its website to be funded later in cash at Walmart stores.;p2p/p2b;http://bankinnovation.net/2014/04/walmart-enters-p2p-space/
261;TD Bank Chooses Popmoney in Big Win for Fiserv TD Bank, the nation’s 10th-largest bank by assets, has chosen Fiserv‘s Popmoney money movement service for its retail banking customers.The news was announced by the bank Monday.It’s about time TD added a person-to-person (P2P) payments option. P2P payments are table stakes today.The TD win adds another large bank to Popmoney’s impressive customer list, which includes many of the nation’s largest banks, such as PNC, Regions, Citibank and US Bank.Popmoney is a person-to-person payment service that allows money to be sent directly from one individual’s account to the account of another. Popmoney offers “instant payments” as well, which means the transfer takes place within seconds, according to Fiserv. Expedited payments such as this typically carry a fee.The table of payments for Popmoney was sent to Bank Innovation by TD Bank:Person-to-Person Payments (Popmoney):3-day delivery (initiated via TDB account) – $1.00 Next-day delivery (initiated via TDB account) – $7.00 (!) Request funds from others (initiated via TDB account) – $1.00Transfer to non-TD Bank customers via the 3-day option will cost $3.00. The Popmoney website says customers of non-Popmoney banks can use the nonexpedited service for $0.95, $0.05 less than TD Bank is charging.Eric Springer, TD’s assistant vice president for corporate communications, described the bank’s decision to go with Popmoney this way:Having partnered with Fiserv to launch TD Bank Bill Pay in the last 12 months, adding their Popmoney service was a natural fit to provide our customers with a full-range of money movement services with the convenience they expect from us. Popmoney is a recognized person-to-person payment service, and it is important that our customers feel confident that their payments are delivered securely, on time and as expected.Real-time payments are a touchy subject in banking today, with NACHA recently promoting a plan for same-day settlement of ACH within two years, and critics saying that would be too little, too late. Popmoney is one of the few US money movement services offering instant or real-time payments, but TD is not offering that at this time.;p2p/p2b;http://bankinnovation.net/2014/03/td-bank-chooses-popmoney-in-big-win-for-fiserv/
262;Coolest Brands 2014: Social Money for the City Dweller Venmo, a social person-to-person payments service, has become a verb. Members of New York’s improv comedy scene, accustomed to (small) informal payments for impromptu performances, have turned en masse to Venmo to settle up. A performer is owed $50 for a quick video shot in Washington Square Park? “Just Venmo it,” he’ll say.Venmo launched in 2009 and was picked up for the bargain price of $26.2 million by Braintree in August 2012. Braintree was then bought by PayPal a year later for $800 million, making Venmo a PayPal company. It has maintained a distinct brand, however, as shown by its ongoing campaign in New York City featuring an employee named Lucas.To use Venmo, users send money as they would with any P2P service, but then have the option of attaching a tweet-length comment or message along with it. Users can then watch the messages of their Venmo-using friends flow by on a Twitter-esque feed. Sarcasm and irony feature heavily, as might be expected.So the next time you need to send money? You might just Venmo it. That’s what Lucas does.;p2p/p2b;http://bankinnovation.net/2014/02/coolest-brands-2014-social-money-for-the-city-dweller/
263;Bank of America Shows P2P Enrollment Process What is the best way for a bank to promote its P2P funds transfer service?Bank of America took on that question in a little-noticed video it uploaded several weeks ago showing the signup process for its money transfer service. The video is noteworthy not only for its homage to the work of director Wes Anderson — note the “precocious young kid” — but for the level of detail it shows in signing up for this process. Since the bank has offered person-to-person (P2P  payment) functionality since 2011, the video is a sign that BofA wants its customers to know that signing up is straightforward, and that its P2P service can use a boost.;p2p/p2b;http://bankinnovation.net/2014/02/video-bank-of-america-shows-p2p-enrollment-process/
264;Square Cash App Doesn’t Appear to Have Much Momentum Square introduced its Square Cash peer-to-peer payments application to great fanfare last October.The app does not appear to be picking up momentum since, however, even when compared only to other financial services apps.The Square Cash iOS app has been slowly falling in the ranking of top finance apps, according to Appfigures data. When Square Cash was launched, it debuted at No. 10 on the list of top finance apps in the United States. As of today, the app is sitting at No. 59. It has also fallen completely out of the Top 400 overall iOS apps after peaking at No. 55 the day after its launch.Meanwhile, PayPal, Square Cash’s key competitor, has maintained its ranking among finance apps and overall, sitting at No. 6 and No. 230, respectively.The Android version of Square Cash has been downloaded 10,000 to 50,000 times on Google Play. ;p2p/p2b;http://bankinnovation.net/2014/01/square-cash-doesnt-appear-to-have-much-momentum/
265;Billon Is Making It Easy To Pay Your Favorite Twitch StreamersPeer-to-peer payments are a big thing these days. I pay you, you pay me, and never the banks shall touch your cash. Billon, a Polish fintech company, is doing their own flavor of P2P by connecting Twitch streamers and other content creators with an audience that can easily tip them using a seamless system of payment.Founded by Andrzej Horoszczak, Maciek Luczak, and Robert Kaluza, the company has been working on the thorny problem of regulatory frameworks and cryptocurrencies since 2012. Horoszczak sold his medical publishing business to start Billon and they have found an interesting niche in the gaming community.They recently brought on David Putts in Europe as Chairman. Putts founded three banks in Europe and spent 10 years at McKinsey. The company has raised angel funding and recently headquartered in London.Horoszczak sees his company as one of the first fully regulated P2P payments companies, which is a hard thing to be. “Billon has created the world’s first blockchain enabling government currency transactions that is compliant with regulations. This is important – mass adoption can only occur if clients are using their existing mobile phones and favorite local currency,” said Horoszczak. “Today, payments are a broken end-to-end value chain full of intermediaries, payment insurers, liquidity providers, clearing agents, settlement agents, and account holders. Imagine giving the power to truly provide an end-to-end solution…and eliminate all the cost, risk, and hassle that exists today.”To gather tips, Twitch users simply add a button to their streams and users can top up their accounts using various methods and then send that money on to their friends. The system allows receivers to cash out in multiple ways including via cash, pre-paid cards, vouchers, and checks. They have 1,300 users after a soft launch and they are working in the sub-$10 electronic transaction market, a huge pool of users that want to send a little money without messy bank fees. The system also allows for interactive chat between the Twitch user and his or her fans.Clearly Twitch is only the first implementation for the platform and they will begin more partnerships this month. Sending small amounts of cash to cool people is an interesting market and Billon aims to lay down the piping to make that happen.;p2p/p2b;http://techcrunch.com/2015/11/10/billon-is-making-it-easy-to-pay-your-favorite-twitch-streamers/?ncid=rss
266;PayPal Launches PayPal.Me, A Simpler Way To Request Money Using Your Own Personalized URLPayPal today is launching a new take on peer-to-peer payments with the debut of a platform it’s calling PayPal.Me. For the first time, PayPal customers will be able to set up their own user profiles which are associated with a personalized URL (e.g. paypal.me/username), which can then be shared with others via text, over email, on instant messenger, via social media, or anywhere else, as a way to request money.This is not PayPal’s only entry into the peer-to-peer payments space, of course. In addition to offering a “request money” feature on its website, the company also operates Venmo. That social app is especially popular with a younger, highly mobile demographic who uses it as a way to do things like pay back friends for money borrowed, or split a check at a restaurant, for example.So it may seem odd that PayPal is launching what at first appears to be something of a competitive product to Venmo. But the company explains that, unlike with Venmo, which only works with U.S. banks, credit and debit cards, PayPal.Me is targeting the company’s much broader global user base.The company today has 170 million active users worldwide, who already take advantage of PayPal to send and request money. With PayPal.Me, however, the idea was to create a mobile-first user experience that makes doing so simpler and faster than with the company’s traditional tools.The company found that people’s smaller debts – the IOUs between friends and family – actually add up to a sizable number when totaled. Globally, adults are owed some $51 billion in total, but most tend to feel uncomfortable asking others to pay them back.PayPal.Me doesn’t eliminate the need for the ask, of course, but it offers an easier way for those who owe money to send a payment.“As conversations became more digital, we needed to find a way to contextualize peer-to-peer payments, and make it easy and intuitive across any different channel, any different device, and any communication means, be it email, text message, instant messenger, etc.,” explains PayPal’s Senior Director of Global Consumer Products, Meron Colbeci, of why the company headed in this direction.According to Colbeci, PayPal.Me will not replace the older experience offered via the web, but instead will just be another option for users.Unlike the traditional online experience, using PayPal.Me is designed to take far fewer steps. In the past, users would have to login to the PayPal website, access the “request money” feature, then enter in another user’s email address to create the request. But PayPal.Me lets you simply share a link.The link itself is easy to remember, as users will claim their own usernames on the service. (E.g. mine is paypal.me/sarahperez.) After setting up your username, you can also customize your profile theme and specify whether you’re using the link for payments between friends and family, or for more professional purposes, like goods and services. Afterwards, to get paid, you just send your link to a friend who clicks it, logs in with their own PayPal information, then reviews and completes the payment on one screen, optionally adding a personal note, if they choose. To make it even easier on those paying, you can also append a number to the end of a personal link to pre-fill in the correct amount. For instance, paypal.me/username/50 would ask for $50.00.Though accessed via the web instead of a native mobile app, the site is mobile-optimized, and alerts about payments are sent out through email as well as via push notifications for those with the PayPal app installed. Payments from one PayPal account to another are immediate, though extracting funds to a bank account will take more time, depending on your bank and your location.In the future, PayPal.Me will also integrate with PayPal’s instant checkout service OneTouch to eliminate the step where users fill in usernames and passwords, assuming they’ve already logged in using PayPal elsewhere on the web or mobile web. (OneTouch lets PayPal users stay logged in across sites.) That will make the payment process even faster.The company says the PayPal.Me service is launching in 18 markets, including  the U.S., Germany, U.K., Australia, Canada, Russia, Turkey, France, Italy, Spain, Poland, Sweden, Belgium, Norway, Denmark, Netherlands, Switzerland, and Austria.The service is intended for now as a “1.0” product,” the company says.“We’re trying to understand how users will want to use this. We’ll collect feedback, and based on that we’ll iterate and make product improvements and features,” notes Colbeci.Those features could include things like bringing in a more social element to the service, where users could perhaps have easier access to a friend list of sorts. Or it could roll out features meant to enhance the business user’s experience. But nothing like that is in development yet, we should clarify.PayPal.Me competes with a handful of peer-to-peer payment apps, including Square Cash, as well as payment options offered by Facebook (in Messenger), Google (in Gmail and Google Wallet) and Snapchat (powered by Square Cash, in the app).Users can sign up for their own username at PayPal.Me starting now;p2p/p2b;http://techcrunch.com/2015/09/01/paypal-launches-paypal-me-a-simpler-way-to-request-money-using-your-own-personalized-url/#.rovkxt4:vLA8
267;Balanced To Close Its Payment Platform, Strikes Transition Deal With Rival StripeThe march of consolidation in the world of e-commerce has claimed its latest victim. Balanced, a payments platform for peer-to-peer marketplace businesses, is closing its doors after failing to grow fast enough, or as co-founder Matin Tamizi describes it, “reach the escape velocity necessary to be a large, innovative, independent player in the payments space.” The company, a Y-Combinator alum, has struck a deal with one of its longtime rivals, Stripe, to act as its transition partner for existing customers.Balanced itself, including its API and dashboard, will shut down in 90 days (up to June 11, 2015). The startup will keep a small team on for nine months from today to support issuing refunds, querying transactions, and fighting chargebacks (until October 9).“We had a lot of respect for what Matin and the team had accomplished, and the broader importance of the market segment,” Stripe CEO Patrick Collison said in an interview earlier today.In an interview, Tamizi told me that the closure will affect around 320 customers, with the current list including sites like crowdfunding platform Tilt, RedditGifts, Tradesy, Relay Rides and Artsy, processing “hundreds of millions of dollars” annually.As a point of comparison, Stripe’s CEO Patrick Collison told me today that Stripe processes “billions of dollars a year for thousands of businesses in 18 countries around the world.” Balanced also competed against companies like WePay, Dwolla, Amazon Payments and PayPal.This is not an acquisition neither of tech nor talent, and there are no financial terms to this deal that are being disclosed. Stripe will honor all of the existing pricing agreements that Balanced has with its customers, and will migrate card, bank account, and seller identity data as part of the deal.Balanced, which was incubated in the YC Winter 2011 class, raised at least $3.4 million in venture funding (some funding was undisclosed), from high profile backers like Andreessen Horowitz, SV Angel, CollabFund, Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky, Ashton Kutcher, and former Reddit CEO Yishan Wong.And — with a payments platform that tapped specifically into the rising number of marketplace startups that connected buyers with a number of sellers of goods and services — it got off to a running start, with companies like CrowdTilt (now called Tilt), Zaarly and The Fancy all picking up its services.The company played up its competitive edge against other payment companies like Stripe specifically in targeting businesses that are built around peer-to-peer businesses. “Balanced’s customer is the marketplace. Stripe’s customer is the merchant. Everything else stems from that difference,” as Tamizi wrote in a post on Quora.And it seemingly co-opted some of its customers to spread the news, too (see here and here for examples). By offering volume based pricing, it attempted to be very competitive against Stripe, Braintree and others.But despite adding some interesting customers to its platform, and passing $370 million/year in payments processed at the start of 2014, that wasn’t enough.As Stripe expanded the kinds of services it offers to compete more squarely against the likes of Balanced, the smaller startup’s customer numbers started to wane. It’s telling that when Balanced reported those momentum figures in January 2014, its customer numbers were approaching 450, compared to the 320 it has today.Among the more notable wins that Stripe has had in the peer-to-peer marketplace segment has been its recent deal to power payments for Kickstarter (which it won off Amazon). Others include Shopify and Squarespace, Collison pointed out to me.That has ironically made Balanced’s biggest competition into its most natural heir.“We tried to choose one best option and in terms of similarity of products and having things that our customers also want in marketplaces. The needs are unique and much more than [what] a standard payments processor provides,” Tamizi said, with that focusing on needing to provide both payment but also payout services. “Stripe has built a lot of that functionality.”But there is also the basic economics of payment services. Many payments platforms — like many of the marketplaces themselves — operate on thin margins that need large volumes to work as businesses.“I think you are right that there are some economies of scale and it is pretty difficult to be a startup payments company in the earliest days,” Collison said. “We were acutely aware of this for the first two years or so. We were lucky that we crossed that chasm.”Tamizi says that today’s decision didn’t come lightly, something you could very much tell from the tone of his voice. “We spent a lot of time thinking of where we are as a company then we made the decision to shut down Balanced,” he said. “The question was whether we could find a graceful transition for our customers and my team.”RIP Balanced, and here’s to brighter days ahead for the team. Full notice below.;p2p/p2b;http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/13/balanced-is-closing-its-marketplace-payment-platform-in-90-days-strikes-transition-deal-with-rival-stripe/
268;Amazon Wants To Include Peer-to-Peer Payments In Its “Real World” PayPal CompetitorEarlier today, the WSJ published a report on how Amazon is building a Kindle-based point-of-sale payments service for local merchants using technology it picked up via its Gopago acquisition –something we actually reported on back in December. In fact, this looks like just part of what Amazon has in mind. The e-commerce giant is also developing a solution for person-to-person payments — bypassing banks and other payment networks — putting it in even closer competition with P2P payment giant PayPal.The P2P payment system, as it’s being conceived, would have a mobile component to it, and it would be cloud-based, so presumably usable over desktop, too.Those Amazon phones we and others keep talking about could be coming soon — the latest that we’ve heard, by the way, is that they may get announced in the next 60 days and ship this summer. Building in a P2P service to sweeten the deal, and help differentiate the phones from the rest of the pack, could be a smart move.Amazon describes the P2P solution as being part of a bigger strategy to build “products and services which will delight billions of customers as they buy and sell things in the real world.”The company is currently looking to hire a number of developers for new payments services beyond those that it already offers online, through its own site and now on other sites. Some of the roles specifically are to develop products that will extend Amazon’s reach “from e-commerce to commerce in general”, and some are specified to work on products for local commerce.One of the ads, for a position as a Senior Technical Program Manager in San Francisco (there is another, identical role in Seattle) is for someone to build a P2P payment product. It reads like this:Our team is charged with extending Amazon’s value proposition (price, selection, and convenience) from e-commerce to commerce in general. We are building products and services which will delight billions of customers as they buy and sell things in the real world (as opposed to online). One of these products is person-to-person (P2P) payments.As part of this ambitious new initiative we need experienced Senior Technical Program Managers to help us deliver a set of innovative mobile and cloud based products. The customer experiences we are building are powered by secure, scalable, and highly available cloud services.You will work with multiple technical teams to deliver solutions, and will be the driving force that orchestrates all the moving pieces as needed to ensure successful and on-time delivery.If you are focused on delivering exceptional products and services that provide exceptional value to end customers, and like to be part of team that likes to have fun… JOIN US!Among the qualifications, applicants are requested to have computer science backgrounds, seven or more years of software engineering experience, mobile app experience, as well as evidence of having cut teeth  product delivery and startup experience. There are a few reasons why it makes sense for Amazon to build a P2P payment platform. For starters, in a side-by-side feature war with PayPal, offering a solution to enable people to send each other money — the basic service that got PayPal started — would be an essential product for Amazon if it hopes to win business away from eBay’s payment leviathan. And PayPal is not the only one playing here. There is also Square with its Cash service and, just earlier today, Ribbon.)Why match the features? Because making a payments platform as ubiquitous as possible makes it also more convenient. In payments, I can’t help but think that the solution that will be the most seamless to use will be the one that wins out. It’s the reason why so many mobile payments services have been such a flop: they’re just simply not as good as what is already in place, between cards and good old fashioned cash.Apart from enhancing Amazon’s overall position in payments, and adding another mobile payment service into the mix, a P2P service would be useful for Amazon on a number of levels.Developing worldAs Amazon has grown, it’s been building out business into developing markets, where there are still a high proportion of “unbanked” consumers — that is, people without financial profiles in the forms of current accounts or credit histories. Creating a P2P framework is one way that Amazon can start to become a bank for these people and potentially bring them into Amazon as would-be customers. One person can transfer money into another person’s Amazon account. That money can then be cashed out, or it can be used to buy goods on… Amazon.Of course, such a solution could also be applied in developed markets, too. Think here of parents topping up their kids’ allowance, in the form of an Amazon accounts, which can be used to buy books, for example.Small merchant relationshipsWhile a point-of-sale solution would help Amazon expand its relationship with merchants who sell in physical stores, a P2P solution could be used to bolster relationships with even smaller vendors who could use it to make and accept payments. This potentially expands the kinds of sellers that might appear in Amazon’s marketplaces, not just for goods but professional services, too, perhaps as a micro complement what it already offers with its Flexible Payments Service for developers.We’ve reached out to Amazon for comment and will update this post as we learn more.;p2p/p2b;http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/29/amazon-wants-to-include-peer-to-peer-payments-in-its-real-world-paypal-competitor/
269;Ribbon Takes On Square Cash, PayPal & Others With A Peer-To-Peer Payments Service That Lets You Send Money For FreePayment company Ribbon, which to date has offered a merchant-facing tool that allows its users to set up a quick-and-easy checkout page on their own sites or share checkout links via social media, is today getting into the business of peer-to-peer payments, too. We first spotted this service while in development last November, when the company had put up a website teasing its forthcoming product as a way to instantly send money to friends over the web.Today, that service has arrived.Explains Ribbon CEO Hany Rashwan, the idea to move into person-to-person payments arose after watching how Ribbon’s current customer base was using the service. To date, the company has seen 10,000 merchants and non-profits sign up for Ribbon, including companies like Target and organizations like the American Cancer Society (Relay for Life), among many other smaller vendors.Not too long ago, Ribbon’s anti-fraud models began alerting the company to the fact that odd payment amounts were being shuffled through the service.“As it turns out, people were using [Ribbon] to do things like collect invoices, collect payments, or as an online cash register – and that’s actually the way that PayPal is predominantly used today,” Rashwan says. In addition, the company found that a lot of users had begun to adopt Ribbon for personal payments, too. “It’s not the Ribbon demographic at all,” he notes, adding that the majority of merchants on the platform were professional sellers – those who made their living selling online.To address the use cases that already existed, Ribbon is today launching its consumer-facing tool. The merchant product will not go away, however. It’s still available at a separate address linked to from the main Ribbon homepage, and will continue to account for the majority of Ribbon revenue – a figure that’s still undisclosed. (Ribbon is also preparing to launch a new embed tool for merchants, which is now being tested).With the new consumer service, Ribbon will step into a crowded space where it competes with other payment options like PayPal, Google Wallet, Venmo (also owned by PayPal), and Square Cash. The difference here, besides not yet being available in a native app format, is that Ribbon works with both debit and credit card users, and will allow you to send payments to others without first having a Ribbon account.The receiver does need a Ribbon account to accept the money, but Rashwan says they’re actually working toward making it so that neither party has to have a Ribbon account in the future.The company’s experience with merchants will help it with the security efforts and risk management around making that sort of change, he says, adding that Ribbon is already keeping its chargeback rate far lower than the level Visa and MasterCard specify (they want it below 1.5%). Of course, Ribbon has hardly reached PayPal, Square or even Venmo scale at this point, making that easier to do.As for the consumer-facing service itself, it’s fairly clever in its design. To send money to any Ribbon user, you just have visit their short URL. (For example, ribbon.co/username.) The requester could send you this URL in a text, instant message, on social media, or email, and after clicking the link, you would enter in your name, email, amount, and payment card information. You can optionally add a quick note, too.To have the URL auto-fill in the requested amount, the requester can append that figure to the URL itself, e.g. ribbon.co/username/125.The site is mobile-optimized, and works with either debit or credit cards. (Square Cash only works with debit, which effectively allows people to deposit money straight into your bank account). Also like Square Cash, debit card transactions are free on Ribbon. (Fees apply for credit card users, but these are the same as PayPal: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction).Another interesting thing about Ribbon’s approach is that it’s targeting those who wish to accept payments to become Ribbon’s early adopters. They will be the ones signing up for accounts, and asking their friends to click links to send them the money owed. The company has been testing its product with a few hundred users so far, and has a waitlist with thousands more, some of whom will be allowed in today.The rollout is staged, but we asked for a way to allow TechCrunch readers in now. The first 500 readers who sign up using this link will be moved to the front of the line.;p2p/p2b;http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/29/ribbon-takes-on-square-cash-paypal-others-with-a-peer-to-peer-payments-service-that-lets-you-send-money-for-free/
270;Apple may be building a peer-to-peer payment app to rival VenmoA new report suggests that Apple is working on a peer-to-peer payment app that would compete with PayPal and its subsidiary Venmo.Apple is supposedly in talks with banks to develop the app, which could launch sometime next year, according to the Wall Street Journal. The news comes several months after VentureBeat reported Apple filed a patent for peer-to-peer payments technology.There are a slew of tech players jumping into P2P payments, including Google, Facebook, and Square. But of all the companies involved, PayPal has had the most success with person-to-person transactions through its social app Venmo. In the last quarter, Venmo processed $2.1 billion in payments volume, up from $1.6 billion the quarter prior.From VentureBeat Customers don’t just get irritated when you screw up cross-channel personalization. They jump ship. Find out how to save your bacon on this free research-based webinar with Insight’s Andrew Jones.That success has led PayPal to open Venmo up to mobile merchants. The company is launching a function called Pay with Venmo, which will allow all of PayPal’s merchants to accept Venmo as a payment method on the Web and in mobile apps.Though there is a lot of movement in this space, mobile payments have yet to take off with consumers. Only five percent of the world’s 650 million NFC-enabled smartphones will be used at least once monthly to make purchases at stores by the end of 2015, predicted a Deloitte report on technology and media. That’s a big leap from last year, when roughly 0.5 percent of people were using their phones for making transactions, according to the same report. Still, five percent is a very small slice of all people who can make contactless payments.Since launching, Apple Pay hasn’t fared especially well. A recent survey from PYMNTS and InfoScout noted that 16.6 percent of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus users have used Apple Pay once, up from 15 percent in March. A little more than a third of users who have tried Apple Pay use it regularly — a figure that’s in keeping with Deloitte’s prediction. In surveys, like the one from PYMNTS and InfoScout, people often say that they either forget to use contactless payments like Apple Pay when they’re shopping or that it’s no easier to use than swiping a credit card. Meaning, mobile payments aren’t yet relevant to consumers.That will likely change, especially as banks realize the security benefits mobile payments offer over traditional plastic cards. Already Chase, Capital One, and MasterCard are nudging consumers with their own mobile app-based payment options.In the meantime, a move into peer-to-peer payments could help Apple to find an audience more immediately. And if there’s one thing we know about Apple, it’s that the company isn’t always first to innovate, but it tends to blow the competition away.;p2p/p2b;http://venturebeat.com/2015/11/11/apple-may-be-building-a-peer-to-peer-payment-app-to-rival-venmo/
271;Venmo announces multi-factor authentication and email notifications in the wake of security issuesAfter facing criticism from users for its lack of security measures, peer-to-peer payment provider Venmo is adding new security features to its platform.Today, Venmo announced it will now send email notifications anytime a user’s email address, password, or phone number changes. In the next several weeks, Venmo will also enable multi-factor authentication.Multi-factor authentication makes users identify themselves with more than just a password. This can manifest as a PIN that gets sent to your phone or as security questions.The changes come weeks after a Slate report highlighted Venmo’s flawed security protocols. The report detailed how a Venmo user had nearly $3,000 stolen from him after someone hacked into his account and changed his login information. Venmo apparently never sent him an email to let him know that the information had changed. He only found out about the charges after his bank emailed him about the large transaction.After the Slate article came out, Venmo issued an apology that listed the ways in which the company tries to protect its customers through PCI compliance and setting limits on the amount of money you can send. But it didn’t illustrate how it would improve security on the service going forward.The company now says it will be more responsive to support inquiries and plans to release additional security features in the near future.;p2p/p2b;http://venturebeat.com/2015/03/09/venmo-announces-multi-factor-authentication-and-email-notifications-in-the-wake-of-security-issues/
272;Uniiverse releases Direct Payments so anyone can sell tickets to anything (exclusive)  Uniiverse wants to make it easier for people to make money doing what they love.The startup released a Direct Payments feature today which sets up peer-to-peer payments for activities and services on a personal website or blog. A yoga teacher can sell Saturday classes in a park, or a food blogger can sell tickets to a cooking class. You can customize the date of the event, type of tickets, and pricing as well as send customized invites, manage bookings, and collect information about attendees.Uniiverse says it connects people in the real world over shared experiences. The goal is to encourage people to engage with others while also providing people with a channel to make money doing what they love.Uniiverse was founded on the belief that human interactions are getting too virtual,” said cofounder and CEO Craig Follett to VentureBeat. “We want to remedy this by enabling people to discover unique things to do. Small businesses and individuals who offer any kind of activity or service can use Direct Payments to integrate payments forms and booking directly on their site or blog. Direct Payments decentralizes the sharing economy, by moving it beyond centralized marketplaces.”The sharing economy has erupted over the past few years to connect people who need something to people who have it. Also referred to as “collaborative consumption,” the idea is to make the most of underused resources by offering them in an online marketplace. AirBnB changed how travel accommodations work by offering other people’s homes rather than hotels. Ridesharing companies like Zipcar, Lyft, and Sidecar are doing this with transportation.These platforms are not only useful for consumers but also for the service providers who can use them to make (or subsidize) a living. Uniiverse’s Direct Payments helps people directly sell their services to consumers (without using a middleman or requiring the visitor to leave the site) by enabling credit card payments and peer-to-peer transactions. Follett said that while companies like Gumroad, Ribbon, and Shoplocket enable people to directly sell products online, no-one is doing this for services and events, which is where Uniiverse fits in.The Toronto-based company launched in early 2012 and now has 11 employees. Its marketplace includes over 26,000 event organizers and service providers in over 400 cities around the world.However, two-sided marketplaces are tough to build, and consumers are fickle. By entering the world of payments, Uniiverse is testing out another way to foster offline commerce (and ensure the company’s survival). It has no setup or monthly fees, though the company will take a small commission from the buyer at the time of the purchase. Uniiverse has been optimized for mobile and accepts all major credit cards.Uniiverse has raised $1.25 million in funding from Real Ventures as well as angel investors.;p2p/p2b;http://venturebeat.com/2013/07/22/uniiverse-releases-direct-payments-so-anyone-can-sell-tickets-to-anything/
273;WeChat launches its peer-to-peer mobile wallet in South Africa, no bank account requiredChinese Internet giant Tencent this week rolled out WeChat Wallet, an ewallet that lives within the main WeChat mobile messenger app, in South Africa. And it says there’s no need to have a bank account to make use of the service.This comes just days after Tencent announced that it’s opening up its mobile payments service to overseas transactions for the first time.To enable topping up and cashing out via the digital wallet, Tencent has partnered with local players in the country including Standard Bank (at its ATMs) and participating retailers including SPAR, SPAR Tops, and Cambridge Food Stores.Mobile payments have been catching on in South Africa for some time now, and Tencent clearly believes it’s spotted an opportunity to jump in (it already has 200 million users on its payments service). And while Apple Pay and Google Pay aren’t yet available in the country, existing offerings like FlickPay, SnapScan, Zapper, and GeoPay are thriving.“Like a physical wallet, you can securely store your bank cards and make instant cash payments within WeChat with the new feature,” Tencent said in a release. “With WeChat Wallet, users can electronically send cash to friends and family, just like handing cash to a friend to get you lunch or pay for coffee or a drink at the bar.”“Information of up to three chip and PIN debit or credit cards, which are verified by Visa and MasterCard security systems, can be saved in the WeChat Wallet. Cards can also be used to Cash In and increase your wallet’s cash balance, pay for services on WeChat such as airtime, electricity, food or pay SnapScan merchants.”Here are the instructions Tencent offers users to get started:Simply log into WeChat, tap ‘Me’, then tap ‘Wallet’ and follow the step-by-step instructions. The service is only available to South Africans who are 16 or older with a valid ID number and are using iOS or Android phones.And here are a series of videos posted to the WeChatSouthAfrica YouTube channel this week as part of the launch campaign:;p2p/p2b;http://venturebeat.com/2015/11/25/wechat-launches-its-peer-to-peer-mobile-wallet-in-south-africa-no-bank-account-required/
274;"Jiffy sets up hotlines for charitable donationsJiffy, the real-time mobile P2P payment system run by SIA on behalf of 50 Italian banks, has set up a mechanism for making charitable donations through the app.The Italian Association for Cancer Research (AIRC) is the first non-profit organisation to make this new method available through the mobile phone number 380.8673811 on the occasion of its ""Research Days"" initiatives. With Jiffy, and the support of 13 of its 50 Italian bank members, AIRC can have the funds donated available immediately with an instant balance statement of the amounts given. Donors must register the telephone number of the non-profit organisation in the contacts list in their smartphone and, from the app, select it, enter the amount and complete the send command with a click. SIA says Jiffy will soon be active for other non-profits and can be used whenever the need arises to raise funds quickly, for example in the case of natural disasters or health crises. The company says the service is compliant with the law concerning charitable donations, which enables donors to benefit from tax credits by supplying receipts for attachment to tax returns.

275;Is Apple working on a mobile P2P payment service?The tech giant is in talks with a number of US banks about developing a new service that would allow people to send money to each other using iPhones, according to reports from the Wall Street Journal.The newspaper cites sources familiar with the matter as saying that the talks with the banks are ongoing but it is not yet clear whether any of them have actually entered into an agreement with the company. Crucial details including the technical factors such as how the service would be integrated into the financial institutions’ existing infrastructures have yet to be nailed down.Apple’s first foray into the payments market with Apple Pay has had an underwhelming first year in the US, leading to Tim Cook’s pronouncement that this year would be “the year of Apple Pay” to be ridiculed. Despite continuing to win over people, the service’s growth has stagnated, according to research.Although it’s unclear how Apple would make money from the service, it is a clear indication of the company’s attempt to consolidate its user base as well as appeal to new customers by diversifying its offered services to include ones that cater to people’s everyday financial needs. It is likely that the mP2P service would work with Apple Pay, which already stores the users’ card information and lets them to make payments.Whilst the launch of the service won’t happen in the short-term, one source said that it could be rolled out sometime next year.;p2p/p2b;http://www.paymenteye.com/2015/11/12/is-apple-working-on-a-mobile-p2p-payment-service/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=is-apple-working-on-a-mobile-p2p-payment-service
276;Google Wallet gets iOS makeover as focus shifts to P2P payments Google has completely redesigned its mobile wallet application for iPhone users, transforming it into a peer-to-peer payments service which enables consumers to manage transactions between friends and family. Keeping up with the competitionOn September 10th Android Pay, Google’s answer to Apple Pay, was released across the United States. This move made Google Wallet, an application with an emphasis on retail mobile payments somewhat redundant. The smartphone tool then shifted its focus towards P2P services.Google Wallet’s revamped application was released to Android users on the same day that Android Pay was launched, and now it’s made its way over to iPhone users.The California-based tech giants are looking to reposition themselves within the mobile wallet space, in order to compete with the likes of Square Cash, Facebook and PayPal, which has launched its new Pay.me service. New featuresThe app has been refurbished to help customers send money between themsleves, citing the sometimes awkward process of splitting a food bill as a prime example. Money can be transferred from a debit card, bank account, or existing Wallet balance.There have been a number of changes made to the iOS version, including a new interface that google claims will make it ‘‘easy to send money to anyone in the US with an email address.’’ Users will be able to easily view their balance and see where they spent their money.You can cash out to your bank account, or spend the money you receive using Google wallet card, which can be used at retailers, ATMs, banks, and wherever MasterCard debit cards are accepted in the US. No additional fees are charged when using the card.;p2p/p2b;http://www.paymenteye.com/2015/09/22/google-wallet-gets-ios-makeover-as-focus-shifts-to-p2p-payments-video/
277;PayPal works with Blackberry on P2P paymentsTroubled phone manufacturer Blackberry has partnered with PayPal on BBM Money, a new P2P payment service that will allow BBM users to instantly send and receive money over the messaging service.Starting from this week, select users in Canada on BlackBerry 10, Android and iOS phones can send money securely with PayPal straight from their BBM app. To use the service users need to click on the PayPal ‘Send Money’ icon in BBM and connect to their PayPal account. Users will not need to have a separate PayPal app.The idea of inserting payments into digital conversations has recently been getting a lot of traction with Facebook launching its payments service within Messenger and Snapchat’s Square-powered Snapcash.;p2p/p2b;http://www.paymenteye.com/2015/08/13/paypal-works-with-blackberry-on-p2p-payments/
278;Is Apple creating a P2P payments platform?The California-based company has filed a patent that could transform the Apple Watch into a peer-to-peer contactless payment device.On July 2nd, a patent application was filed by the technology giants, detailing equipment that would allow its customers to transfer money to each other using a combination of wireless, Bluetooth and NFC technology.The patent states that the technology is suitable for ‘‘electronic devices (such as cellular telephones)’’, but rumours suggest that the Apple Watch will be chosen as the firstdevice to model the P2P system.‘‘An individual using an electronic device may… provide an encrypted payment packet to the other electronic device that includes: a financial credential for a financial account of the individual, a payment amount, and a payment sign,’’ stated the patent.In terms of making secure transactions, Apple’s Touch ID security feature will be need to be executed by customers in order for each payment to be authenticated.Similar P2P payment solutions already exist. In 2010, PayPal allowed iPhone customers to transfer money between each other using its ‘‘bump’’ feature.;p2p/p2b;http://www.paymenteye.com/2015/07/08/is-apple-creating-a-p2p-payments-platform/
279;Snapchat makes surprise move into P2P payments marketSnapchat has leapt headfirst into the P2P payments market with a new function allowing users of the messaging app to send money to one another.The new feature has come about through a partnership with payment-processing firm Square. Snapchat users who are over 18 and based in the US can add a Visa or Mastercard debit card to their account. They then type a dollar amount into Snapchat’s text-chat feature, which recognises the dollar sign and provides a green pay button that will instantly send a friend money.If the friend fails to sign up and accept the payments within 24 hours, the cash will be refunded to the senders account.Snapchat has had some privacy concerns in the past, which might discourage people from signing up for its payments feature. But it seems that all account details will be held independently by Square Cash, which will have much riding on this joint venture as it attempts to sideline competitors such as Venmo.While a financial agreement between Snapchat and Square has not been discussed, both have plenty to gain. Being integrated with Snapchat could net Square serious exposure and additional credit card numbers. This is also Snapchat’s first big experiment with becoming a full-fledged messaging platform, as it eyes the success of China’s WeChat or Korea’s KakaoTalk.Ultimately, Snapcash is targeting a younger generation who already use Snapchat to regularly interact with their peers, and who may not have thought about downloading a separate payments app. While the ease of integration still needs to outweigh some serious privacy concerns, this is an interesting development for the social P2P payments market.;p2p/p2b;http://www.paymenteye.com/2014/11/18/snapchat-makes-surprise-move-into-p2p-payments-market/
280;Amazon ditches P2P payment serviceAmazon will be shutting down its free Webpay peer-to-peer payments system from mid-October, having made a low impact in the competitive online payments market.Amazon has offered the free service to Amazon Payments users for the last four years, and the offering was largely viewed as an attempt to challenge PayPal’s hold on the online financial services market. But with Google and Square also offering similar P2P services, the e-commerce giant has decided to abandon Webpay.Even its passing has not caused much of a stir, perhaps illustrating the limited impact the service had.Webpay allows users to send digital cash to anyone by email, using only a credit card or their Amazon account. Because it can be characterized as a payment by the sender and as cash by the recipient, transactions are cost free. Webpay users will still be able to make payments until the service is pulled on October 13th, and recipients have 30 days to claim funds before money is returned to the sender. Even after that date, users will still be able to see a history of their transactions.“We are not addressing a customer pain point particularly better than anyone else,” Amazon admitted on its website. “We’ve learned a great deal about how and when customers want to send money and will look for ways to use these lessons in the future.”;p2p/p2b;http://www.paymenteye.com/2014/09/17/amazon-ditches-p2p-payment-service/
281;FIS brings instant P2P payment capabilities to EverBankFIS has announced a partnership with EverBank to provide FIS People Pay to its clients. People Pay enables users to pay anyone with their mobile phone number or email address. Also recipients can receive funds directly to their bank account or via a gift card.People Pay utilises FIS’ PayNet network, which moves money instantly between deposit accounts of both consumers and businesses.“EverBank clients want to be able to quickly send payments online or from their mobile phones to friends, family or colleagues, using just an e-mail or mobile number, and they trust us to provide those payment services safely and securely,” said Vincent Amato, EverBank Senior Vice President and Director of Banking Operations. “FIS People Pay allows us to provide such a service, fully branded to our bank, so our clients have the safe, secure payment services they’re looking for.”“Studies have shown that customers are not only interested in instant money movement, but also that they want their financial institution to provide it, and they’re willing to pay for the ability,” said Nancy Langer, Division Executive, FIS ePayment Solutions. “P2P payments can serve as a way to establish a relationship with younger and mobile-first customers and to set your financial institution apart from competitors. And when you can offer a system that was designed specifically for customers, you give them the ability to send money as they see fit.”;p2p/p2b;http://www.paymenteye.com/2014/09/05/fis-brings-instant-p2p-payment-capabilities-to-everbank/
282;Fiserv Popmoney tapped by US Bank for instant P2P paymentsUS Bank is the first large bank in the country to offer real-time P2P payments online and through mobile devices using the Popmoney Instant Payments feature, a product of Fiserv.The real time P2P payment feature expands US Bank’s existing P2P payment service, which it has offered for over a year. Now, customers can send money instantly to friends, family and service providers who bank at participating financial institutions. Instant receipt of funds depends on network availability and, for financial institutions that do not offer the Popmoney personal payments service, depends on the funds availability policy of the financial institution.Another enhancement recently offered by U.S. Bank enables customers to make the gift of money much more personal by giving customers the option to select virtual cards to attach to payments made over email for special occasions such as birthdays, graduation or holiday gifts.These new features are available via US Bank online and mobile banking, giving customers more ways to send, request or receive money using their friend or family member’s account number, email address or mobile phone number. In addition to the Instant Payment option, U.S. Bank customers can choose from next day or standard P2P payments.“Providing our customers with the latest digital banking and payment capabilities is a priority for US Bank,” said Brendan Devine, vice president of money movement at U.S. Bank. “It’s not just about the ‘wow’ factor associated with having the bells and whistles that no one else has, but about U.S. Bank being a trusted resource that our customers turn to first when they want to manage or move their money.”“Designing payment solutions using a ‘real-time first’ mentality, which assumes that real-time is the ultimate standard of delivery, is a guiding principle in the ongoing Fiserv initiative to make faster payment options available to consumers,” said Marc West, senior vice president, Electronic Payments, Fiserv. “The powerful combination of real-time and mobile opens new doors for adoption and use of person-to-person payments, and U.S. Bank is at the forefront of this trend.”;p2p/p2b;http://www.paymenteye.com/2014/04/28/fiserv-popmoney-tapped-by-us-bank-for-instant-p2p-payments/
283;TD Bank introduces P2P payment and external transfer features for online banking customersTD Bank has recently launched person-to-person payment and external transfer services, providing customers with an option to transfer money to accounts at any US bank or to other people.The services are available for all eligible personal banking accounts that are enrolled in TD Bank online banking and will give customers the option to schedule one-time, future-dated or recurring transfers to or from their own non-TD Bank accounts, send money to another person’s TD Bank or non-TD Bank account.TD Bank has partnered with Fiserv to offer Popmoney to provide customers P2P payment options, complementing the bank’s convenient online banking tools.“Customers want services that make banking easier for them,” said Rizwan Khalfan, Senior Vice President, Digital Channels, TD Bank Group. “Secure ways to manage their money online is increasingly important to people, and these services help meet the needs of their on-the-go lifestyles.”The bank’s external transfer service will enable customers to use their eligible TD Bank accounts to transfer funds to or from their transaction accounts outside of TD Bank.“From writing a check to using Bill Pay or Popmoney, we’ve given our customers choices so they can bank how they want, when they want.” said Nandita Bakhshi, Head of Retail Distribution and Product for TD Bank.;p2p/p2b;http://www.paymenteye.com/2014/03/19/td-bank-introduces-p2p-payment-and-external-transfer-features-for-online-banking-customers/
284;"Morning Scan: Apple Eyes P2P Payments; Bank Recruiting LagsApple Eyes P-2-P Payments: In a bid to claim a bigger stake in the payments industry, Apple has begun talks with banks to launch a peer-to-peer payment service. The service would target the market already enjoyed by PayPal's Venmo and Square's Square Cash, the Wall Street Journal reports.

285;How Apple could shake up mobile person-to-person paymentsWith no one company currently dominating person-to-person payments on mobile, Apple is reportedly hoping to extract the significant value that exists in this area for the right player.As millennials increasingly use their mobile devices to make small payments to one another, P2P payments have attracted a number of companies, from early pioneer Venmo to more digital giants such as Facebook and Google. Now Apple is reportedly looking to throw its hat in the ring as it looks to drive adoption of mobile payments more broadly and to fill out its mobile services ecosystem.“A consideration to drive adoption of Apple’s service might be cost and if they can become the least expensive mobile P2P service for consumers,” said Talie Baker, an analyst at Aite Group.“The market is pretty much wide open, no one player is currently dominating the space so there is a good opportunity for Apple given their market penetration and consumer comfort with Apple products,” she said.Bill sharing While mobile payment adoption overall has been slow, P2P mobile payments have gained some traction with millennials looking to share bills, such as when they go out to dinner. Apple may be looking to gain a foothold in P2P mobile payments to support its Apple Pay service.According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, Apple is in discussions with a number of major U.S. banks about a potential P2P service. This suggests that the service would enable users to make payments from their checking accounts to another person.An Apple P2P service could be integrated with the company’s Apple Pay, which enables users to pay for purchases in stores and online.Apple may be looking to launch the service as early as next year.Competitive landscape Apple would face a number of competitors on this space.Venmo, an early player, is now owned by PayPal and accounts for 19 percent of mobile P2P payments.Google’s new Wallet also offers P2P payments and Facebook launched a similar service through its Messenger app earlier this year.Square also plays in this area.“Apple faces a highly competitive and fragmented competitive ecosystem,” said Jordan McKee, senior analyst for mobile payments at 451 Research. “Apple will be one of many providers, and will face difficultly in displanting fast-growing services, such as Venmo.Despite the competition, Apple could bring some key advantages to P2P mobile payments.“Apple has a unique opportunity to tightly integrate P2P payments into the overall device experience – something no provider has the capability of doing today,” Mr. McKee said. “It’s easy to see how Apple may layer P2P payments over iMessage, creating a compelling and intuitive service.“Apple can also push P2P payment functionality down to an iPhone via a software update, whereas other providers have a more tedious path to drive adoption,” he said.“Should Apple enter the P2P payments sector, this will create a shockwave across the competitive landscape. While Apple has been known to drive attention and adoption toward specific sectors that it enters, it’s as equally as well known for disintermediation.”Driving mobile payments adoption One benefit of a P2P payments service for Apple would be to help drive adoption of mobile payments and help boost its Apple Pay service.In some cases, consumers more readily adopt P2P mobile payments as opposed to using their devices to pay for purchases in a store.The thinking goes that once they discover how easy it is to pay with their phones, they may be more likely to adopt mobile payments to purchase merchandise and services in stores and online.Aite’s research showed that only 40 percent of millennials used a mobile payment method in 2014 and other generations used mobile payments even less.“Consumers are looking for convenience and the more they become comfortable with transactions on their phone, the more likely they are to continue using the phone for new functionality,” Ms. Baker said. “If they become comfortable with mobile payments to merchants, that will help drive mobile P2P and vice versa.“It will be interesting to see which one takes off more strongly first,” she said.;p2p/p2b;http://www.mobilecommercedaily.com/how-apple-could-shake-up-mobile-person-to-person-payments
286;Why peer-to-peer payment is PayPal’s lucrative next frontierPayPal’s peer-to-peer payment platforms such as Venmo and PayPal.Me have seen significant user adoption already, with Venmo’s payment volume clocking in at $1.6 billion in 2015’s second quarter, suggesting that these types of mobile services are an important road forward for the brand.PayPal’s recent split with online marketplace eBay is enabling the brand to focus more heavily on its suite of mobile payment options, a lucrative frontier considering the proliferation of consumers who have become comfortable with making transactions via smartphone and tablet devices. Mobile shopping will also continue an upward trajectory in the coming months, as more marketers roll out apps and mobile sites equipped to provide seamless checkout experiences with services such as PayPal’s OneTouch.In an interview with Mobile Commerce Daily, Anuj Nayar, senior director of global initiatives at PayPal, discusses the company’s recent mobile payment ventures, challenges that brands may face in the future and the growing focus on marketing its peer-to-peer platforms.How important is leveraging mobile platforms for PayPal?Leveraging mobile commerce is extremely important to PayPal. Mobile commerce is growing far more quickly than ecommerce, as a whole, and eMarketer predicts that these sales will increase by 32 percent in 2015.This growth will be driven by the increased use of smartphones for holiday shopping as larger screens, mobile-optimized Web pages, newly-developed retail apps and faster mobile checkouts create smoother transactions. We believe this is a huge opportunity for businesses to engage their customers and increase their sales, especially as the holiday season nears.Mobile commerce is one of the most significant drivers spearheading such a transformative period for business. The most successful retailers will provide a more seamless experience for shoppers, whether they walk into a store, order online, via mobile browser, via an app, or call on the phone. What role do you see peer-to-peer payments playing in mobile over the course of the next year?Globally, the market for peer-to-peer transfers and remittances is worth well over $1 trillion. Although mobile payments are growing, debit account payments represent one of the smallest pieces of the digital payments pie, behind in-store payments and in-app payments (purchases made through an ecommerce app on a phone).With peer-to-peer payments, people can link their debit card accounts online and digitally transfer money to anyone, essentially replacing cash and checks. It is for this reason, PayPal recently launched a new mobile peer-to-peer payment platform called PayPal.Me.Through this landmark initiative, over 169 million active PayPal users can create their own user profiles linked to a personalized URL (e.g. paypal.me/username). This link can then be shared with others as a way to request money via text, over email, on instant messenger, or via social media.PayPal’s Venmo is also a major player in peer-to-peer payments – in Q2 2015, payment volume on this service was $1.6 billion, up an astounding 247 percent year-over-year. So in short, we believe that peer-to-peer payments will play a significant role in mobile usage over the next year. Has mobile payments adoption among consumers been slower or faster than you expected? How about with merchants?After examining the online and cross-border shopping habits of 17,600 consumers in 22 countries, one thing is clearly evident: mobile shopping is on target for meteoric growth. Consumers are increasingly more comfortable buying on mobile devices.In fact, they’re buying as many mobile devices as they are desktops, and during last year’s Black Friday, there was a 62 percent increase in mobile ecommerce volume! Mobile payments adoption amongst consumers has been much faster than we expected, and we envisage it will continue to grow in the near future.As mobile technology becomes more integrated into its users’ lives, the importance of digital wallets increases as a way to pay. This is the perfect time for merchants to go mobile. The new generation of shoppers is increasingly abandoning the inconvenience of bricks-and-mortar stores – and mobile-savvy businesses will reap the rewards.What is the biggest new opportunity in mobile this year?PayPal conducted a global survey of mobile shopping trends and found that 47 percent of those who have shopped via mobile prefer to use an app over a browser because of convenience and speed. So while many businesses have been focused on creating mobile-friendly sites, it is important to develop an app strategy.The same survey also discovered that a younger demographic, 18 to 34-year-olds, accounts for 59 percent of mobile shoppers. For businesses that target millennials, having a well-developed, easy-to-use app will be especially important.One business that illustrates this perfectly is Jane.com, which was recently ranked number 11 on Inc. Magazine’s list of the fastest growing private companies in the country. The boutique marketplace features the latest in women’s fashion trends, home decor and children’s clothing.Noticing an uptick in purchases made via mobile browser, the company decided to simplify its mobile shopping by creating an app for its customers. Today, 35 percent of overall revenue comes from the app, and mobile Web traffic continues to grow as well!This holiday season, another big opportunity for merchants to drive business growth is contextual commerce, a phrase to describe shopping that can be completed in other digital channels outside of merchants’ online shopping sites. Mobile devices and shoppable social together will enable the full potential of contextual commerce.If businesses want to effectively reach consumers, then they should be paying attention to shoppable social. Anyone engaged in retail or selling services would benefit from getting a ‘buy’ button distributed to their customers wherever they are.Do you have a mobile milestone of the past year that you would be willing to share?Here at PayPal, we’re constantly innovating in order to help merchants expand their sales channels. Last year, we processed four billion payments, and one in four were made on mobile devices. To continue our mission of developing better experiences for our mobile customers, PayPal launched some key initiatives.We extended our One Touch checkout experience early this year by linking our One Touch Web and mobile experiences. Now, consumers can make single tap purchases from mobile apps even if they don’t have the PayPal app.Last September, we launched One Touch with PayPal, which has led to as much as 50 percent or greater improvement in mobile conversion rates. We believe that this development will usher in a new generation of more connected consumers and merchants.This year, on September 1, we also launched PayPal.Me: a new peer-to-peer payment service that allows people to send or collect money with just a link. It is available on mobile (iPhone and Android), desktop, and tablet.Users can personalize their own PayPal.Me link, which syncs to their PayPal account and can be shared with friends or customers. If someone doesn’t already have a PayPal account, signup is fast and free. There’s also a selectable option for anyone paying for goods or services, so any eligible purchases will be covered by PayPal’s standard buyer protection policies.;p2p/p2b;http://www.mobilecommercedaily.com/qa-why-peer-to-peer-payments-will-become-paypals-lucrative-frontier
287;Have you had any challenges with any mobile approaches?Anyone who sells online knows that shopping cart abandonment is a common problem and consumer expectations around mobile shopping are even higher. With the proliferation of mobile commerce, merchants need to think “mobile first” to compete – as in, designing the entire customer experience with mobile top-of-mind.The need for checkout simplification is even more important on mobile, where entering shipping and billing details on a tiny mobile screen is a significant barrier to purchasing.Can you discuss any upcoming mobile initiatives that PayPal has for consumers and/or brands?We are rolling out new innovations such as One Touch, which greatly improves the online and mobile buying experience. Consumers who opt-in to One Touch can securely checkout across all eligible merchants without needing to enter a username, password or payment information, so long as they are using the same device.Eligible merchants get One Touch automatically – no integration is required to directly address the number one issue they face, which is shopping cart abandonment.In addition to our branded PayPal wallet, we also have Venmo, a U.S.-only peer-to-peer digital wallet. Venmo will become more important as the world adopts digital wallets, which now only represent one percent of the total $25 trillion retail opportunity.With a 16-year track record of building trust with millions of customers around the world, we at PayPal will continue to roll out initiatives in the same vein to provide merchants and customers shopping with ease – anytime, anywhere.;p2p/p2b;http://www.mobilecommercedaily.com/qa-why-peer-to-peer-payments-will-become-paypals-lucrative-frontier
288;Apple’s P2P mobile payment service would ‘create a shockwave’ in the industryIf Apple creates a mobile person-to-person payment service, it could rock the banking and payments world as never before, some analysts believe.     There are already several person-to-person (also called peer-to-peer, or P2P) mobile payment services offered. They include PayPal’s Venmo, as well as services from Facebook, Google, Square and others. The Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed sources, reported Wednesday that Apple was in talks with major banks to develop such a payment service, possibly as an extension of Apple Pay.Apple has won consumer trust through the years in ways that those competitors and conventional banks can’t match.“Should Apple enter the P2P payments sector, this will create a shockwave across the competitive landscape,” said Jordan McKee, an analyst at 451 Research. “While Apple drives attention and adoption toward specific sectors that it enters, it’s equally well known for disintermediation.”Apple is “heavily and almost solely focused on the consumer value proposition, ” added Gartner analyst Avivah Litan.“Banks have realized that Apple is more adept at providing consumers with compelling value propositions and users interfaces than they are, and banks are anxious to follow Apple’s lead and ride their bandwagon so that they can get a piece of the action rather than being left out in the cold altogether,” Litan added.Banks had false starts with person-to-person payments, back in the early 2000s when Bank One and Citibank offered their own services, which never took off, Litan said. PayPal’s Venmo service proves that P2P payments can succeed more easily on mobile platforms because “the user experience is superior,” she said.Venmo officials said payment volume on its service jumped 200% in the third quarter of 2015 from the prior year, hitting $2.11 billion. A Venmo spokesperson, responding to the report that Apple is talking to several major banks about creating a P2P payment service, said: “We welcome any development that encourages people to address the awkwardness of dealing with cash when paying friends or family back.”Venmo has a potential advantage over any future Apple service because it works across multiple devices and operating systems, while Apple would presumably only support iOS devices. Venmo has about one-fifth of all mobile P2P payments, according to Aite Group, a consulting firm in the payments space.Apple would face difficulty supplanting Venmo, McKee contended, but the company also has a unique opportunity to “tightly integrate P2P payments into the overall iPhone experience — something no provider has the capability of doing today.”Apple could layer P2P payments atop its iMessage service, creating a “compelling and intuitive service,” McKee added. Apple could also push P2P payments software down to any recent iPhone via a software update, while other providers would face a more complex path to drive adoption.Apple reportedly wouldn’t charge banks for using its potential P2P payment service, which shows that Apple is intent on luring users into daily use of the iOS platform, for payments and other services, like music and video.In any future Apple P2P service, banks stand to benefit from Apple’s high standing with consumer satisfaction. But banks also might see long-term cost reductions through a P2P service as a replacement for inefficient and costly checks and cash, analysts said.But cash and checks are still heavily used in the U.S., so any widespread adoption of P2P payments could take years, if not decades.Africa points the way to P2P mobile paymentsThe use of P2P mobile payments is already widespread in many developing countries, especially in some nations in Africa, where the use of banks is very low and consumers are often referred to as “unbanked.”“P2P is big in Africa and usually works through the wireless carrier’s billing or prepaid systems and the interface is SMS,” Litan noted.The prospect that the U.S. or other developed countries might move someday to a P2P mobile payment system that cuts out well-established banks and credit card companies may seem farfetched. But not entirely.An Apple P2P mobile payment service “could be a viable model in other countries,” added Darren Hayes, an assistant professor and director of cybersecurity at Pace University.“P2P payments have been around for many years in certain countries where credit cards aren’t trusted,” Hayes said. Also, PayPal isn’t available in every country, which could give Apple a potential advantage.Apple’s iPhones are highly secure and users are likely to trust them for P2P as they have for Android Pay, Hayes said.Hayes said he is often called as an expert witness in courtrooms where he provides smartphone forensics testimony, after working with law enforcement agencies to break down confiscated smartphones to find critical data needed for investigations. He said iPhones are the most difficult smartphones to break into.Given Apple’s high level of security with the iPhone and Apple Pay, it would likely “engender trust for people who are looking for alternatives to pay, as well as for using something other than a credit card,” Hayes said. “It’s just a logical step for Apple to move to P2P.”P2P mobile payments, long termThe biggest implications for Apple and its competitors in mobile P2P payments are long term. In coming years, P2P payments could help replace the use of checks and could even help consumers largely cut banks out of the payment process.“We’ll see P2P payments continue to displace paper checks,” McKee said. “Checks could become extinct in another 10 to 15 years. The impact on cash will be less dramatic.”Some P2P apps, like Venmo, could evolve into full-scale mobile wallets, which might be what Apple foresees.“You could pay a merchant directly via your P2P app, completely circumventing the payment networks” which have been built up over decades by banks and credit card companies and many third-party companies, McKee said.“The attractiveness of this approach to merchants is apparent, since it would result in reduced fees” that merchants now pay to banks for credit-card transactions, McKee added.One implication of McKee’s futuristic scenario is that big banks could be working with Apple on a P2P mobile payment scheme in order to avoid being cut out of their share of future transactions.Apple wouldn’t comment on any plans for P2P mobile payments.;p2p/p2b;http://www.cwi.it/apples-p2p-mobile-payment-service-would-create-a-shockwave-in-the-industry_81766/

The new interface is designed to help the mobile payment service help consumers pay for more products, while receiving discounts and allowing its users to become more social with each other — all within the app.“The new Alipay app is no longer a wallet,” Fan Zhiming, President of Ant Financial’s payment business unit, said in a news release. “[It is a] platform which will change the way you shop, the way you spend and the way you manage your finances.”Users can also gain access to Ant Financial’s money-market fund via the app, as well as other money-management tools.The new interface is available both for iOS and Android and has two new tabs that can help its users keep organized on the app. The tabs are designated “merchants” or “friends” and can help users organize their financial needs and contacts better, Ant Financial noted in the release.In its remarks about the new feature, Ant Financial explained that: “Through the Merchants tab, users can learn the locations of nearby restaurants and shops, get discounted coupons, and settle payments at merchants’ e-shops via Alipay, as they can when shopping online.”Alipay enables users to pay at shops by having a merchant scan a barcode or QR code. Alipay local services are also going to be available with Koubei, which was a joint venture between Alibaba Group and Ant Financial to help market more local services. Koubei is an expansion of Alibaba/Alipay’s mobile business that seeks to blend the “real world” and “online” shopping experience into a single, fluid commerce event – mainly by focusing on restaurants and brick-and-mortar stores. On the platform, Ant Financial will provide merchants with tools.And it will enable consumers to connect with those merchants (along with friends and family).“Imagine a user as the center of one’s daily life and our app aims to ink the connections for them,” Zhiming added. “Whether it is money transfer, recommending a restaurant, we put you at center stage in Alipay 9.0.”O2O is a natural expansion of Alibaba’s mobile business, as it works to navigate the switch to a digital commerce environment dominated not by computers but by devices. O2O services allow Alibaba to capture the attention of shoppers wherever they are, whenever they are shopping. An Alibaba customer in a brick-and-mortar shop can look to the Alibaba’s app discounts and promotions, use their Alipay wallets for purchases, or order goods from local stores for delivery.;p2p/p2b;http://www.pymnts.com/news/2015/alipay-wallet-adds-p2p-payments-and-gets-new-name/
291;Visa Prepares European Tokens And P2P PaymentsApple Pay is coming closer to reality in Europe as Visa prepares for a mid-April launch of  a tokenization service customized for the European marketplace.The practice of swapping out a 16-digit credit card number with a basically meaningless token number is considered a necessary component in the future of payments security, and has been since Apple chose to make it the central security feature for Apple Pay.Steve Perry, Visa Europe’s chief digital officer, noted in an interview that his firm’s plan for secure credit card data transmission parallels what Visa Inc offers in the United States. He declined to comment on whether Apple Pay had agreed to use Visa’s tokens in European markets.“Apple and Visa (Inc) have an agreement around what has happened,” Perry said. “I am as excited as anyone, but we have to wait,” he added. The Visa Europe executive referred further questions to Apple.Visa’s announcements this week were not all about tokens, however.  The firm has also announced an intention to create a peer-to-peer payment service that will allow users to transfer cash, in real time, using just a mobile phone number or Visa card number.The service will be called Visa Direct and will supplant Visa Personal Payments, the existing P2P protocol with about 200K users in Europe. It will be hooked in to Facebook and Twitter to allow users to transfer funds between social media services.Visa has additionally rolled out an API to make it easy for banks to integrate the service, and is geared for a summer 2015 launch.;p2p/p2b;http://www.pymnts.com/news/2015/visa-prepares-european-tokens-and-p2p-payments/

The agreement will enable money transfers between private individuals, also known as peer-to-peer, across the US via the digital payment solution SEQR. It is expected that the launch of peer-to-peer in the North American market, supported by Dwolla, will take place in the first quarter of 2016.Dwolla’s payment platform provides SEQR with the opportunity for a rapid roll-out of peer-to-peer payments. By utilising Dwolla’s infrastructure SEQR is able to launch peer-to-peer in the US ahead of having all of its own money transmitter licenses approved.“Money transfers between private individuals is a very popular service in the US. Under the agreement with Dwolla, we can quickly offer SEQR’s US customers a peer-to-peer service which is something our customers in Europe already make great use of. Peer-to-peer is growing rapidly in the US,” says Peter Fredell, CEO of Seamless, and continues:“In parallel with the launch in partnership with Dwolla, we are continuing to secure money transmitter licenses in the US within the scope of our own solution, which will ultimately prove more profitable.”This is the type of information that Seamless Distribution AB (publ) is required to disclose pursuant to the Securities Market Act and/or the Financial Instruments Trading Act.

295;Over the past ten years, numerous startup firms with digital business models have emerged within the Wealth Management (WM) industry. According to our analysis of over 50 WM startups, these firms are Business-to-Consumer (B2C) focused, and primarily serve retail investors in three ways:1. Connect. Helping investors connect to their peers, multiple accounts, and multiple sources of advice.2. Advise. Providing investors with advice tailored to their unique situations and delivered through a rich, digital experience.3. Invest. Providing access to esoteric investment opportunities and investment strategies similar to those used by professional investors and institutions.Although it’s unlikely these new firms will draw large amounts of market share away from leading wealth management franchises over the next five years, they will likely continue to grow because they target investor needs that established firms are not currently satisfying. Also, they offer a convenient online client experience that retail investors have increasingly come to expect.Leading WM franchises have been monitoring these digital startups for a while, but thus far only a few have responded with enhancements to their own digital presence. However, our research shows the tide is starting to turn and a growing number of incumbents are looking to selectively invest in building digital capabilities that will help broaden their appeal with younger clients and other digitally savvy retail investors.The disruptive power of digital technologies business models is creating opportunities for new firms to make a big splash in the wealth management industry. However, other kinds of financial services firms — such as asset management and insurance companies — may be able to leverage similar capabilities to provide client advice and add greater value through their own distribution channels.Established WM firms that do not learn from digital startups and adjust their business models accordingly could find themselves at a significant disadvantage in the marketplace. On the other hand, incumbents that learn to use digital technologies to address unmet needs and deliver a superior client experience may be able to leapfrog the competition and capitalize on emerging market opportunities;Wealth Management;Deloitte - Digital disruption inWealth Management
296;Online wealth management startups have entered this market and successfully attracted financial planning customers by setting up digital storefronts based onwell-designed platforms that have a low learning curve. These companies can form a complete picture of a client’s financial situation by taking into consideration personal financial goals, risk tolerance, diversification, and/or investment strategies.Examples of these digital storefronts include Personal Capital and Learnvest. Personal Capital offers an investment platform with multiple options, from tracking and analyzing investments to financial advisor services (for investors with over $100,000 in assets). Account aggregation enables users to monitor their finances as part of a single, integrated dashboard that shows asset allocations, potential portfolio risks, and how different product fees might impact their goals. Personal Capital aims to merge online money management with personalized case-by-case guidance.It features an integrated dashboard and also provides personal advisors to help investors navigate their financial data and challenges.Learnvest goes even further by acting as an online coach. The company provides an online tool that helps users track their spending, visualize their budgets, and attain their financial goals. It also facilitates discussions by allowing users and their financial planners to both view the user’s dashboard at the same time. In addition, Learnvest offers ten-day boot camps on finance-related subjects such as becoming a parent, shopping for clothing, and navigating one’s career. Learnvest also offers financial education by connecting users with Certified Financial Planners (CFPs) who can answer questions and perform complimentary evaluations. For young adults interested in working one-on-one with their assigned financial planner, a variety of service bundles are available to help them accomplish their life goals. CFPs use information about a person’s spending habits, budget, and financial goals to offer specific advice and help individuals understand how money, expenses, and debt will continue to affect their lives as professionals;Wealth Management;Deloitte - Digital disruption inWealth Management
297;One of the first movers in this market was Mint.com. Mint is a free online personal finance service that allows users to see all their balances and transactions in one place. Launched in 2007, Mint now has over 1 million users, making it one of the largest and fastest growing account aggregation services. Once a user provides their logins, Mint automatically pulls in daily information about bank accounts, credit cards, loans, property, and investments from nearly all banking and financial institutions in the U.S. — giving users an up-to-date view of their money with no data entry, import or synching required. Mint automatically categorizes transactions, calculates budgets by category, and shows cash flow for each month. To keep users engaged, the service also sends email and SMS alerts about upcoming bills, low balances, and unusual spending. In addition, Mint.com offers personalized recommendations on alternative products a user may be interested in. The recommendation engine is a source of revenue as affiliates pay to have their products put in front of desired clients. Myprosperity is conceptually similar to Mint, with a focus on financial planning. Myprosperity can aggregate bank, credit card, investment accounts, and assets (e.g. home, car) into a single dashboard, providing the user with a real-time view across multiple accounts and financial institutions. The site has a budgeting tool to help users monitor spending and manage savings goals. A “financial fitness score” is generated to measure against personal goals and preferences. It also facilitates users’ need to share information with the financial and legal professionals through a limited access portal.Large incumbent firms could offer something similar to Mint and Myprosperity by building account aggregation into their current digital front-ends (websites/mobile apps), as it would likely require minimal integration with current systems. Many B2B financial services technology firms provide products to help incorporate aggregation into a company’s infrastructure. Once a comprehensive picture of a client’s wealth has been captured, incumbent firms may be better positioned to systemically provide effective financial advice andcross-sell new products and services — enabling more effective share of wallet strategies. Another potential use of account aggregation is to offer services to families and other groups of individuals, where different members would have different levels of access to the financial picture.;Wealth Management;Deloitte - Digital disruption inWealth Management
298;The main trends driving the launch of the digital wealth management market follow. • Generational preference: A large percentage of Generation X (Gen X) and Y (Gen Y) investors are entering the years during which they hope to accumulate wealth. More than half of Gen Xers and Yers over the age of 20 are currently between the ages of 30 and 49 (representing approximately 80 million individuals).1 These investors are more comfortable interacting with financial services firms online or over the phone than are baby boomers. • Internet adoption: Seventy percent of the U.S. population is now connected to the Internet via a broadband connection (in 2005 only one-third of the population was connected to broadband) and over one-third own a tablet computer.2 This high adoption rate means that reaching the mainstream and low-balance investor online with a wealth management offer has never been easier. In addition, advances in communications and Web technology give a majority of investors access to high-class wealth management services online (graphics, fast transaction processing, etc.). • An up market: The stock market is rising again, which means that more investors are looking to make changes to the way they manage their wealth compared to five years ago. • Attractive technology: Coupled with the debate over whether advisors should be held to a fiduciary standard, the financial crisis reduced the allure of the financial advisor and increased the attraction of investing with a more objective and consistent technology-based proposition. ;Wealth Management;Aite - Emerging Players in Digital Wealth Management: Competing for the Everyman Investor
299;"Financial Guard's mission is to provide professional, unbiased, transparent retirement investment advice to the masses. The firm aims to address the unmet retirement advice needs of investors holding up to US$250,000 in investable assets through a graded analysis of their existing retirement investments followed by the recommendation of an optimal portfolio and a list of securities to buy and sell. Financial Guard also provides quarterly rebalancing instructions, primarily through email. Customers are able to automatically aggregate investment information through Yodlee's account aggregation technology (Financial Guard also works with Intuit for aggregation).The service provides mutualfund and exchange-traded fund (ETF) recommendations following a proprietary grading system that scores every ETF and mutual fund based on characteristics of the security (performance, style, risk, etc.) using data from Lipper and other market data providers. In addition, Financial Guard takes into account investors' investing preferences, which it deduces from investors' existing portfolio as well as directly from investors through a three-question risk-profiling tool.Simplifying the retirement investing process and providing easy-to-understand and actionable recommendations are key characteristics of Financial Guard. Another simplicity trait is the letter grade (""A"" through ""F"") it assigns to portfolios and securities, allowing customers to quickly assess where they stand with their investment portfolio (Figure 2). Individual securities with a buy or sell recommendation are also assigned a letter grade based on past performance and fees. As with similar services, recommendations are often to sell all or most funds/securities in the portfolio and replace them with lower-cost funds. This advice may be hard for investors to accept and act on, especially since portfolio changes often entail transaction costs and, when they realize capital gains, additional taxes.Financial Guard is marketing its services differently from its competitors. Whereas Jemstep and SigFig came to market initially to acquire end investors directly through Web marketing and social media, Financial Guard came to market initially as a white-label solution for benefits providers and retirement plan sponsors. When Financial Guard came out of its beta phase in late 2012, the solution was already delivering advice on more than US$200 million in assets. The firm's integration with a large benefits provider should help the firm prove the value of its investment advice and acquire additional benefits providers and retirement plan sponsors.Recent conversations with Financial Guard's executive team indicate that the firm will be announcing more institutional deals in the near future. Regarding the business-to-consumer service, the firm provides end investors with a one-month free trial to increase investor comfort with the quality of its advice. Thereafter, the solution costs US$15.95 per month or US$149.95 per year. Of course, one month may not give investors enough time to make an informed opinion about the service, particularly since two of the firm's competitors, Future Advisor and SigFig, provide similar investment advice services for free.";Wealth Management;Aite - Emerging Players in Digital Wealth Management: Competing for the Everyman Investor
300;"FlexScore was founded by Jeff Burrow and Jason Gordo, two former financial advisors who started their careers at Wall Street brokerages and then created their own asset management company, Valley Wealth Inc., to implement their own vision of growing and managing client wealth. In 2012, they started FlexScore to deliver their financial planning expertise to a broader audience online. The solution is currently still in beta with an expected launch in the first half of 2014.FlexScore's purpose is to empower people to take more control over their financial lives by giving clients an engaging way to connect with their finances, specifically through a score that represents how well they are managing their finances and progressing toward their goals. The score is based on household financial information, including assets, debt, income and expenses, insurance, estate-planning documents, and tax situation.The FlexScore ranges from 0 to 1,000 points, where a score of 1,000 indicates that individuals are in perfect financial shape based on their current financial situation and ability to achieve their financial goals in the future. FlexScore wants to be the financial success score that goes beyond the credit score. Individuals can compare their score to those of others residing in the same ZIP code to get additional perspective on what their score means. The firm hopes this peer-comparison tool will drive households to improve their financial situation or boast to friends about their above-average score.Households can boost their score through action steps that add points to it. These action steps could be educational (""watch this video to learn more about life insurance"") or more concrete (""increase your life insurance coverage by US$320,000""). FlexScore recommends financial product providers and website aggregators, and it earns referral fees from these partners (Figure 3). The firm hopes its primary revenue source will come from selling its software to financial services firms. FlexScore has the potential to help any American household that has Internet access manage and improve its financial life. Giving mass-market and mass-affluent Americans access to cost-effective, comprehensive, and independent financial advice has been a challenge under the traditional model of delivering advice through a dedicated financial advisor. Financial advisors ultimately need to be compensated for their work, and mass-market households typically cannot afford to pay the hundreds or thousands of dollars required to obtain a financial plan. In addition to addressing the financial advice needs of an underserved population, FlexScore makes the process of financial planning manageable by breaking the planning process down into bite-size action items. By contrast, the traditional financial planning process is daunting, time-consuming, and often a one-point-in-time exercise that requires significant effort to update in later years.FlexScore currently requires users to enter their financial information manually. This will change soon—FlexScore indicated it would be including account aggregation capabilities in the first half of 2014. With this addition, the firm will be able to give clients an up-to-date view into their complete financial situation and how they stand relative to their financial goals.When comparing FlexScore to other free financial information aggregation and visualization services from firms such as Personal Capital and SigFig, the solution has two unique competitive advantages:_ It provides financial advice across a range of financial-planning topics, and the action plans can link clients directly to product providers. Multiline financial services firms should be interested in using this tool for prospecting. should appeal to institutions seeking a prospecting tool that any advisor can understand and use to educate potential customers.Since the firm's presentations at Finovate in the spring and fall of 2013, several financial services firms have requested access to FlexScore's enterprise solution. Interest has come from banks, brokerage firms, financial planning firms, credit card issuers, and credit unions. The firm is also working to license its technology internationally through representatives in Australia, Canada, Germany, South Africa, Denmark, and England. In countries where financial advisors must follow a fiduciary standard (e.g., Australia) or can only earn fee-based revenue, banks and employers may find a good solution in FlexScore-like offerings for investors who may be unwilling to pay financial planning fees.Also keen to tap into the U.S. retirement market, FlexScore is working on its retirement plan optimizer, which will allow users to input their company retirement plan options and receive a recommended investment selection based on their FlexScore and investing preferences.The firm appears to be gaining traction and is ahead of its registration goals while still in beta. The firm will be formally launching its enterprise solution and an advisor solution in early 2014. By the end of 2014, Aite Group expects to see announcements with several brand-name financial services firms. Financial institutions should take a close look at FlexScore's solution as a way to provide greater value to clients and prospects through the Web and mobile._ It summarizes clients' financial situation through one score that reflects both their current situation and their likelihood to achieve their goals.

301;"Michael Blumenthal, a former stockbroker and a serial entrepreneur, founded Jemstep. He came up with the idea for Jemstep while managing his own family assets and receiving questionable advice from brokers. Jemstep's mission is to provide a better outcome for investors in retirement by proposing both a model portfolio and a list of securities (ETFs and mutual funds only) to achieve the optimal portfolio. Jemstep works with Windham Capital Management to build model portfolios based on 14 asset classes. Clients receive service through the firm's website as well as through email and Web chat. The firm does not currently provide phone-based support.Jemstep bases its recommendations on an understanding of the client's current retirement portfolio, retirement goals, and investing preferences. Specifically, recommendations take into account:1) An investor's or household's current retirement portfolio (automatically aggregated using CashEdge technology)2) Time to retirement3) Investor income (spousal income entered separately)4) Annual retirement savings5)  Expected Social Security benefits6)  Comfort with risk (based on an individual's comfort with the largest one-year loss in his or her portfolio)7) Investment preferences (passive, active, ETFs versus mutual funds)Jemstep provides complimentary asset allocation recommendations and explains why its model is better than the investor's current one (Figure 4). The solution also provides a few security recommendations, also for free, to give the investor a sense of the premium service. The premium service includes:_ Buy and sell recommendations and detailed explanations_ An analysis of fund performance, fees, expenses, and the tax consequences of every transaction_ Periodic alerts for adjusting asset allocation or upgrading specific investments_ Quarterly updates and recommendations for optimizing the portfolio and staying on trackPortfolios of up to US$25,000 benefit from free recommendations; for individuals with less than US$25,000 to invest, signing up for Jemstep's complimentary offering is a no-brainer. Individuals with retirement portfolios exceeding this amount will pay a monthly fee depending on the total assets aggregated with Jemstep. An investor with a portfolio of US$150,000 to US$300,000 would pay US$29.99 per month or less than 25 basis points (e.g., 18 basis points on a portfolio of US$200,000). Given these low costs, Jemstep can address the industry challenge of delivering affordable, unbiased investment advice to the mass market and mass affluent. Jemstep's direct competitor is Financial Guard. The firm also faces competition from firms that provide free buy and sell recommendations (Future Advisor) as well as from firms that manage investments on behalf of investors through a low-cost portfolio (Wealthfront and Betterment).Ultimately, Jemstep faces the challenge that all online investment advice providers face: convincing the end client that its advice and methodology is worth paying for. Investors may need to time to gain comfort with the advice before signing up for a fee-based online advice service.

302;"Founder Jon Stein started Betterment with the goal of providing any saver with a cost-effective and transparent savings solution based on a portfolio of 12 stock and bond ETFs. While the investment solution appears simple, the individuals behind its design are savvy existing and former finance professors and investment managers. Betterment was one of the first online investment management firms to raise funds from venture capitalists and attend Finovate. The firm has stuck to its mission since its founding, and its focus has helped the firm grow AUM to US$300 million in a relatively short time.Betterment's simplicity, ease of use, and the efficiency of its service stand out. Betterment's website consists of two ""sliders"" and two input boxes that allow investors to view the impact of different contributions and asset allocations on their assets over a designated time period (Figure 7). The account opening and funding process is electronic, and funds in most cases transfer from bank accounts within one business day. Betterment's enhanced customer service, Rollover Concierge, handles retirement plan rollovers. Executives at the firm boast that they can complete a transfer of assets from a 401(k) plan in about five days, whereas the industry average rollover is 30 days.Betterment recently announced the acquisition of ImpulseSave, a service that encourages saving by allowing consumers to automatically send funds from a checking account to a savings account tied to specific goals. Betterment clients can now divide and align the funds in their account with different goals and asset allocations. Betterment will recommend an allocation to bond and stock ETFs based on the time horizon of the goal. Funds for long-term goals such as retirement will see a larger allocation to higher risk/higher return ETFs, for example. Customers are not required to follow Betterment's recommended allocation, however, and could opt for a more conservative or aggressive portfolio for each goal. Using its own proprietary rebalancing software, Betterment rebalances the account to minimize taxes. This goals-based portfolio management capability is still not possible at many established wealth management firms.In addition to its recent enhancement to the way clients can invest, the firm rolled out a new portfolio in December 2013 based on 12 asset classes (up from eight). The additional four asset classes are fixed income subcategories, including corporate bonds and two international bond categories. In addition to providing greater diversification, Betterment claims that this new portfolio improves risk-adjusted returns through better risk management, particularly for aggressive portfolios. Betterment's service fee is low, ranging from 15 to 35 basis points depending on investors' balances (15 basis points for portfolios of US$100,000 or more). Unique to Betterment is that this fee covers trades.

With the exception of Rikki Tahta, these founders are no longer with the firm (Perry Blacher is a partner with one of the venture capital firms financing Covestor's recent Series B financing round). The founders were replaced with experienced executives from financial services and technology firms. Following the firm's change in management, venture capitalists are optimistic about Covestor's growth prospects; the firm recently raised US$12.75 million in a Series B financing round from Union Square Ventures, Spark Capital, and Amadeus Capital Partners.The company's core value proposition is bringing the benefits of active portfolio management to end investors through a transparent online marketplace of portfolio managers. Covestor attracts portfolio managers who are looking to reach the retail market and grow AUM for a specific strategy. Portfolio managers include RIAs, registered hedge fund managers, and individuals, and they represent a diversity of strategies and approaches to generate alpha. Covestor carefully selects portfolio managers for its platform after an application and due diligence process that lasts an average of 18 months. The firm ensures that the portfolios meet consistent performance and risk targets and adhere to the firm's trading rules.End investors search for portfolio managers based on a tool that matches their risk tolerance, net worth, and desired investment amount. Each portfolio has its own Web page of information describing its strategy, past performance, holdings (only clients can see the full list of holdings), fees, performance, and portfolio risk (Figure 8). Once investors select a portfolio manager and open an account with Interactive Brokers, Covestor manages investors' assets based on the model portfolio selected and the manager's trading decisions. Covestor developed a proprietary trading capability, Portfolio Sync, which replicates portfolio managers' trades. Covestor collects a management fee ranging from 50 to 200 basis points depending on the portfolio manager's strategy. Portfolio managers receive a share of this fee in accordance with Covestor's compensation schedule (typically 50% of the investor fee).

They built an algorithm that reviews investments held across multiple accounts and recommends changes that minimize trades, favor low-fee index funds, and achieve a diversified portfolio given an investor's age, risk tolerance, and investment time horizon. Investors include Sequoia Capital, Kapor Capital, Y Combinator, and Youniversity Ventures. Executives at Future Advisor have backgrounds in investing algorithms design, operations research, and private equity. At this firm, computer scientists and engineers outnumber finance professionals; this is by design, for Future Advisor positions itself as a provider of unbiased advice due to its reliance on algorithms and computers instead of people and product manufacturers. The firm seeks only to earn revenue from investor fees and is not interested in compensation from product providers.After aggregating investors' assets using CashEdge, the solution analyzes how well the overall portfolio matches the performance, diversification, fee, and tax efficiency of a model portfolio that is appropriate for the specific individual. The service then recommends specific buy and sell transactions to better align the portfolio with the model. This service is free, as are rebalancing alerts, but Future Advisor charges clients for automated rebalancing. The firm just shifted from a flat monthly payment to a more common asset-based payment of 50 basis points (Figure 9). The premium service is offered through two tiers: a silver service for accounts with less than US$50,000 and a premium gold service for investment management of more than US$50,000. The gold service also includes automatic tax-loss harvesting, offsetting dividends and gains with losses at the end of the year to minimize taxes.

307;"The practice of private wealth management continues to change as quickly as it grows. For insight on key business trends that will influence wealth management over the next three to five years, CFA Institute Magazine invited three experts to share their views in a roundtable discussion: Stephen Horan, CFA, CIPM, managing director of credentialing at CFA Institute; Mark Tibergien, CEO and managing director at Pershing Advisor Solutions, LLC (a BNY Mellon company); and Scott Welch, chief investment officer at Dynasty Financial Partners. The following excerpts were taken from the participants’ remarks. A subsequent column will discuss the impact of technology trends.Stephen Horan (CFA Institute): One thing that I think is getting some more recognition but is largely unnoticed is the increasing significance of women as clientele. Right now, women control about half of the wealth in the US, but they’re estimated to be in control of two-thirds of the wealth by 2020. That’s stunning. The reasons for that are they’re inheriting wealth, they’re entering the work force at a greater rate, and they have a greater longevity, so they hang on to that wealth and as a result have longer retirements. Women also tend to be better savers than men. So you’ve got this changing face of the investor base along the lines of gender, and I think any adviser would tell you advising a woman is very different from advising a man, which is different from advising a couple.We’ve spent so much time focusing on retirees and retirement needs that we’ve sort of taken our eye off the ball that there is an up-and-coming millennial investor base that is becoming increasingly significant in terms of numbers. It’s not so much about wealth yet, because they have yet to accumulate significant wealth, but they’re partly at the core of this robo-adviser movement. And what’s interesting about them (beyond their obvious penchant for digital solutions) is that they disintermediate investment planning. By that I mean you don’t really need an adviser to do all the things that they currently do; [investors] can interact more directly with financial markets.But millennials are also just very different types of investors; they are far more cautious and risk averse than prior generations. For example, they hold about half their savings in cash, compared with less than a quarter for all other age groups. They hold more than twice as much cash.What’s interesting about these things taken together is that we have an investor base that increasingly looks less and less like the adviser base, which is middle-aged men—and that perhaps could be generous on the age side [for the adviser base]. That’s going to continue to create challenges for advisers who are trying to serve clients who don’t share the same perspectives and life experiences, [who have a] penchant for digital solutions and things like that.Mark Tibergien (Pershing Advisor Solutions): There is an acute talent shortage facing all the financial services. Since 2008, there are 50,000 fewer financial professionals in all. I think the average age for principals is around 61, but the average age for all A11advisers is about 50. Only 10% of the adviser population is under the age of 35. In fact, the CFP Board [Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, Inc.] says they have more CFPs over the age of 70 than they do under the age of 30.Whatever you use as your data point, the face of the advisory business is gray and wrinkled, and that is a challenge because we as an industry have not done a good job of making this a compelling industry to work in. We [Pershing Advisor Solutions] asked our Millennial Advisory Board to casually inquire among their friends who are not in this business why they chose not to come into finance. There were three reasons cited: (1) I never studied it in high school and didn’t know it was a career choice; (2) everything I know about the industry is bad; it’s corrupt; it’s not a place that profoundly helps the lives of other people; and (3) it’s just a sales job, and I don’t want to be in sales. So, as a profession, we have a lot of work to do to demonstrate that it’s actually a helpful career; it’s not a sales job. If people are not learning personal economics in high school, that probably explains why people make a lot of bad financial decisions.Mark Tibergien (Pershing Advisor Solutions): This is the only profession where clients pay for the value they bring rather than the value the professional brings—meaning that, the richer I am, the more that I pay. It’s kind of a classic Marxist sort of approach to pricing when you think about it. What’s happening is that firms do continue to charge basis points on assets, but in many cases, they’re also charging a retainer or a project fee for other services. But it’s not uncommon in the high-net-worth space to actually see a 5–10 basis-point increase in the asset management fee.There are six levers of profitability in a wealth management firm. Pricing is one of them and perhaps the most controllable, but the others relate to volume, meaning that many firms are not growing at a rate fast enough to keep up with withdrawals. Productivity is becoming a real issue, because [firms are] not managing workflow well, and that’s a function of capacity. Third, the service mix may not be well defined, and one reason it’s not well defined is because of the fourth lever, a poor client mix, where the firms don’t have enough clients within their sweet spot. The fifth lever relates to cost control. Finally, bull markets camouflage a lot of sins, and in some respects, we’ve seen this persistent growth in the equity markets, which has allowed for creeper costs to come into a number of advisory firms. If you look at those six levers [pricing, productivity, service mix, client mix, cost control, and creeper costs], you have to say it isn’t just pricing that determines my margins; it’s “How do I manage the rest of the ship in order to produce an optimal bottom line?”Scott Welch (Dynasty Financial Partners): One trend on the investment side is the democratization of the investment solution set that’s available to clients. A second is simply what I call the “race to zero” in terms of active asset management fees.One aspect of the democratization trend is the explosion in the number of liquid alternatives, or alternative investment mutual funds, that are now available. Both the quantity and quality of those strategies continue to improve, and that will make accessible to a wider audience of investors the kinds of strategies that historically have only been available to qualified purchasers or accredited investors.This is not to suggest, by the way, that hedge funds or LPs (limited partnerships) are doomed for the graveyard. I think the good ones will continue to thrive and prosper. But the door is now open to a much wider set of investors to build far more diversified and sophisticated portfolios beyond simply stocks and bonds.A second trend is the explosion of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), so-called factor-based ETFs, and other low-cost structures now available to investors. I don’t like the phrase “smart beta,” but that is the industry shorthand for factor-based ETFs.As a simple example, Eaton Vance got approval not too long ago for a new kind of structure called an ETMF (exchange-traded mutual fund), which is an actively managed ETF. It has the daily liquidity of an ETF, but the fund company doesn’t have to disclose the underlying positions within that ETF on a daily basis like it does with a traditional ETF. Its disclosure is based more on the mutual fund standard of every six months, which will allow that ETF provider to more actively manage the strategy without daily transparency into it. I don’t know if it will be a good product or a bad product, but I do know it will work to drive down the price of active management.When you combine all the different lower-cost investment products that have and will continue to come out, I think it’s undeniable that there will be a deep impact on active managers. Premium managers will always be able to charge a premium price, but many active managers are going to have to change the way that they manage their books in order to justify their higher fees. That’s why I refer to this trend as the race to zero, and it’s happening both at the product level and at the advisory level because of digital platforms.I think we will see a similar impact in the LP and hedge fund space in the sense that the truly brilliant investors will survive and thrive, and they’ll continue to be able to charge premium prices for premium performance. Clients will still be willing to give up liquidity and pay a higher fee in order to get access to that performance. So, I suspect that “star managers” and things like private equity and other illiquid investments will continue to be very popular. But these pricing pressures pose a distinct competitive threat for the folks who aren’t premium providers.The bottom line from an investment perspective is that an end investor now can build a very sophisticated, very globally diversified portfolio at a far lower cost and with far better liquidity terms than that same client could have built even five years ago. Asset managers and wealth managers are going to have to respond to all of these trends. In an era of commoditization of services, they will need a differentiated business model and clear articulation of their value proposition to justify their higher fees. And in the wake of downward pricing pressure, they will need to focus on core competencies and increase their use of outsourcing to drive profitability.";Wealth Management;https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2015/10/05/what-trends-are-influencing-the-future-of-wealth-management/
308;"The automation revolution is sweeping the industrial world, and the asset-management industry is no exception. So-called ""robo advisors"" have been proliferating; seeking to outcompete human alternatives by providing automated investment guidance at a lower overall price point. But most robo advisors are flawed in design, according to Walt Vester, CEO of Huygens Capital. That's why his firm has worked to produce a better mousetrap - a 100% automated robo advisor that provides investors with U.S. equity exposure in a ""tactical, systematic, risk-managed"" manner.""Most robo advisors manage risk by constructing an initial, diversified, multi-asset portfolio for a client, and then maintaining that static asset allocation with periodic rebalancing whenever the portfolio deviates from it,"" said Mr. Vester, in a recent statement. ""The issue with this approach is that no asset class performs well in all market regimes, so at any time the portfolio has some component with a poor risk/return tradeoff.""By contrast, Huygens Capital's robo-advisor investment system uses proprietary predictive analytics to monitor market conditions daily, rather than monthly or even quarterly. Equity market sentiment can change quickly in response to changes in economic, political, or other factors, and the system re-assesses conditions at market close each day.Huygens's robo-advisor investment products - listed below - switch between portfolios of U.S. equity index ETFs and U.S. government bond index ETFs according to the firm's assessment of institutional money-manager sentiment. When the big managers are bullish, Huygens favors stocks; when they're bearish, Huygens prefers bonds.";Wealth Management;http://seekingalpha.com/article/3572806-huygens-launches-trio-of-tactical-robo-advisor-strategies
309;With EUR 18 trillion of financial assets1 held by individuals, Europe represents one of the largest wealth management opportunities in the world. Individual financial assets have been growing at 4.3% per annum since 2010—approximately one percentage point faster than European nominal GDP. Furthermore, with average returns on equity of 13-15%, wealth management is still favoured by capital markets over other financial services businesses. Wealth managers are currently valued at price-to-earnings multiples of 10-12x,2 higher than their corporate and investment banking counterparts at 6-8x. Finally, wealth management remains attractive especially for established players, with personal relationships underpinning client retention and high fixed costs acting as barriers to entry. However, the wealth management industry faces a number of significant challenges. Due to its attractiveness, competition between players is increasing, and industry profit levels continue to be approximately 20% below pre-crisis levels. Newly created wealth has also been limited, with new inflows accounting for 25% of the asset growth and the balance of 75% coming from market appreciation.From the client perspective, the industry faces further challenges. Trust in wealth managers and financial markets has not been fully restored since the financial crisis, causing changes in client behaviour. For example, clients are increasingly making direct investments in real estate and private equity (not through wealth managers) and maintaining higher deposit levels. Despite these challenges, capital markets expect wealth manager executives to deliver significant earnings growth of approximately 6-7% per annum. Against this backdrop, the industry is poised to change significantly. Our executive interviews and research have helped us to identify four main forces behind this change:•The next generation of clients is emerging as wealth is created in new industries and a peak transition of wealth to a younger generation occurs over the next 20-30 years.•Digital innovation will provide opportunities to better engage and service clients, but will also enable innovative players to disrupt the market.•A regulatory focus on client protection and stability of the financial system is creating numerous challenges for wealth managers, but is also opening up opportunities for differentiation.•Demand for full tax transparency (in response to OECD rules and automatic data exchange, for example) is putting the traditional offshore model under pressure.;Wealth Management;OLIVER WYMAN | J.P. MORGAN ASSET MANAGEMENT
310;"The wealth management market is attractive in terms of size, growth, and capital markets attributes (return on equity, price- to-earnings multiples, forecast revenue growth, etc.). Financial assets of individuals in Europe reached a total of EUR 18 trillion in 2013, with assets of high net worth individuals (HNWIs) and ultra high net worth individuals (UHNWIs) accounting for around EUR 7 trillion or 39% of the total.4 HNWIs5 controlled around EUR 4 trillion of assets, while UHNWIs5 accounted for the remaining EUR 3 trillion. Since 2010, growth in financial assets of individuals has outpaced nominal GDP growth by nearly 130 basis points per annum (4.3% vs. 3% compound annual growth rate).Looking ahead to 2018, we forecast that the financial assets of individuals in Europe will reach EUR 23 trillion, with HNWIs and UHNWIs accounting for EUR 9 trillion. With UHNW and HNW assets growing at nearly 6% per annum, we expect the wealth management industry to continue to outpace growth in the region's nominal GDP (around 4% per annum)6 and the assets held by affluent/retail clients (around 4% per annum).Across Europe, wealth management markets are forecast to grow at rates of 4-8% per annum. The largest markets by assets (Germany, the UK, Russia and France) will continue to account for over 50% of the region’s HNW and UHNW financial wealth.For shareholders, wealth management offers relatively higher levels of return and more growth opportunities than other banking sectors (e.g. return on equity, price-to-earnings multiples). This is because it employs lower credit risk with attractive fee levels, leading to low risk-weighted balancesheets and higher returns on equity, enabling more attractive dividend returns.Industry incumbents remain well-positioned because they have long-standing, personal relationships with clients which can be hard for new entrants to bypass. Additionally, growing regulatory and operational costs create high barriers to entry, making it difficult for new or smaller players to compete against established firms. This positive outlook on the wealth management industry is reflected in our survey, with 82% of wealth managers expecting the market to be attractive or very attractive over the next five years. While the wealth management market is attractive, it also faces significant challenges: competitive intensity is increasing, fees are being compressed, costs (especially compliance costs) are rising, client trust has been dented and investors have high growth expectations. These challenges require wealth managers to fundamentally redesign their value proposition.The wealth management market is competitive and continues to attract new entrants. Currently, approximately 80% of investment products in Continental Europe are distributed through banks, but this could be poised to change. Clients are becoming more familiar with non-bank providers such as financial advisers, multi-family offices (which now have over 10% share of private banking assets under management (AUM) in Germany), online wealth managers and non-financial players.Industry profit levels are still approximately 20% lower than pre-crisis levels. The decline in profitability is due to lower revenue yields and increased costs, e.g. cost of implementing regulatory change. Revenue yields are being compressed, by factors like RDR (Retail Distribution Review), MiFID II (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive), changes in asset mix and increased allocations to passive investments.Furthermore, trust in wealth managers and capital markets has yet to be restored following the financial crisis. This has caused clients to take wealth out of the hands of wealth managers. A recurring theme expressed during our executive interviews was that clients are increasing their direct investments (for example, in real estate and private equity), thereby bypassing wealth managers altogether. Similarly, deposit levels are currently at 35% of total financial assets, still five percentage points higher than pre-crisis levels, indicating that wealth managers are struggling to make the case for their investment products.Finally, shareholders expect senior executives of wealth managers to deliver significant earnings growth, approximately 6-7%, which will be a challenge to achieve in the current environment. Over the last few years, approximately 75% of asset growth was driven by returns on existing assets, with only 25% of growth from net new inflows; such reliance on the markets for growth presents a real risk.";Wealth Management;OLIVER WYMAN | J.P. MORGAN ASSET MANAGEMENT
311;We expect a significant change in the European wealth management client base in the coming years. Firstly, there will be a peak in intergenerational wealth transfer to a younger generation. Secondly, new wealth is being created by entrepreneurs, who are often involved in innovative industries with significantly different cultures than prior industries.Survey respondents agree that tailoring the wealth management offering to the next generation of clients is important, with 66% ranking it as a top priority. According to the European Central Bank approximately half of all wealth in Europe is currently controlled by people over the age of 55 and will be transferred to their next generation over the next 20-30 years. This next generation of clients however is also likely be over the age of 55 when they inherit this wealth. In addition to this wealth transfer, managers should also closely follow the creation of wealth in new industries, such as technology, which are emerging as thefastest generators of wealth. From 2011-2014, billionaires’ wealth in such new industries grew by 29%, in comparison to 21% in traditional manufacturing and engineering industries.As with any next generation of clients, they will be characterised by distinct behaviours and expectations. Whether they have grown up with technology or adopted it later in life, the next generation of clients has a strong preference for digital tools. Research suggests that 67% of millionaires below the age of 40 accessed their portfolios remotely in 2013. Increased access to information generally prompts greater self-determination, and we expect that these clients will be more involved in investment decisions. They will also likely demand an increasingly broad array of services, ranging from online access to capital markets research to portfolio optimisation and scenario-testing tools. Amongst the newly wealthy, there is also an increasing inclination to seek professional advice, with the wealthiest establishing family offices and those from lower wealth tiers turning to independent financial advisors. As of 2012, globally, an estimated EUR 1.8 trillion in financial assets was managed by roughly 5,000 family offices, with at least 50% of single family offices established in the past 15 years.Research by the Corporate Executive Board suggests the proportion of millionaires seeking financial planning advice increased from 29% in 2012 to 34% in 2013, with this trend expected to continue in the short term.As this next generation of clients takes centre stage, wealth managers that can customise both their service model and the way they interact with these clients are far more likely to succeed.Digital technology has disrupted a wide range of industries over the last decade, leading to new business models and the ousting of incumbents. For example, online messaging services like Skype and WhatsApp have cost traditional telecommunication providers such as Vodafone and O2 EUR 24 billion in global text messaging revenues in 2013. Additionally, traditional hotel companies such as Hilton Hotels and Starwood are competing against online lodging providers like Airbnb, which found accommodation for seven million guests in private homes.Technology-driven business models are attracting new clients and assets in wealth management:•Automated discretionary mandate providers: Offering fully automated portfolio construction and rebalancing based on client preferences and risk profiles, e.g. Nutmeg, which provides portfolio management services to 35,000 users.•Thematic or social trading platforms: Offering trading ideas based on crowd-sourced investment themes or social trading where clients can automatically copy the trades of others (often professionals), e.g. Motif Investing.•Comprehensive wealth management: Providing full suite of wealth management services online including, investment management, financial planning, trading, and banking, e.g. Personal Capital has 500,000 users and EUR 363 million in client assets.•Non-financial services companies: For example, online marketplaces that offer yield earning money market accounts to shoppers and suppliers, e.g. Alibaba Group launched a money market fund targeted at the domestic Chinese market that, at the time of writing, is the fourth-largest money market fund in the world with EUR 67 billion AUM.Our survey substantiates that competition is changing. Although today’s large players are expected to maintain their dominance, their market share will be slightly reduced in the future. Today, 64% of respondents consider large wealth managers to be their primary competitors, but in five years only 48% expect this to be the case. Non-financial players and online wealth managers are expected to gain ground over the next five years, with non-financial players increasing to 20% and online wealth managers increasing to 30%.;Wealth Management;OLIVER WYMAN | J.P.

312;Money management giant BlackRock has acquired financial advisory service FutureAdvisor, which uses algorithms instead of professionals to help manage its clients’ investments.Similar to competitors Betterment and Wealthfront, FutureAdvisor’s computers analyze customer accounts and recommend investments based on the goals of the account holders.The terms of the deal were not disclosed.

313;"At first, robo advisors caused some advisors to worry about competing and surviving in a market shifting toward millennials and low costs. Now, they're facing the same concerns.It's true that assets of online managed accounts are expanding rapidly; advisory firms continue to roll out their own robo offerings; venture capital continues to flow into digital wealth provider platforms, as valuations for some close in on $1 billion, while deals for tech providers reach record figures. But underlying these positive trends are nagging concerns about performance, survivability and profitability of many digital wealth providers. Despite company pronouncements to the contrary, algorithm-based robo advisors saw assets drop during the recent correction. Even the most successful platforms aren't expected to be profitable for another decade, but they are already engaged in expensive advertising campaigns to gain clients.

314;When the first robo advisors appeared a few years ago, they seemed intent on cutting traditional advisors out of the equation. Their goal was to bring basic financial planning and investment management services directly to consumers through the Internet at a low cost.Members of the advisor community typically had one of two reactions to these intruders. Either they dismissed them or they feared them. Those who dismissed them focused on their long-standing, traditional offering and the fact that they appeared to be targeting smaller accounts and younger generations with little to invest.  On the other hand, those who feared them were advisors who had relied too long on their own plain vanilla offering and felt threatened by the robo’s low cost. Both groups missed the most significant aspect of the robo movement. The robos offered proof to everyone that the client experience and advisory firm efficiency could be vastly improved through technology. Now that advisors are beginning to see how they and their clients can benefit from robo technology, they are looking for ways to implement it. But the choices can be overwhelming. A multitude of options have cropped up offering what seems like an endless number of ways for advisors to access this new technology. Each one is slightly different. Sorting through the choices doesn’t have to be a painful process if you have a good framework for analyzing the alternatives. The first step is to understand the various capabilities that robo technology can provide. The next step is to identify the capabilities that will provide your clients with the experience you want for them and the efficiencies you want for yourself.  Before you can decide if robo technology is right for you, and if so, the best way to implement it at your firm, you need to understand what is covered by the term robo-technology. Once you understand the basic components of this technology, you can decide which of those components you would like to employ at your firm.•Client Engagement Tools.  These tools allow clients and prospects to go to your website and interact with your firm.  They include questionnaires, account aggregation tools, portfolio analysis tools, portfolio recommendation tools and financial planning tools.•Onboarding Tools.  These tools are used to bring a prospect on board as a client.  They allow you to automate much of the process and allow a prospect to open an account online without paper forms, “wet” signatures or paper checks.  Using these tools you or a client can open and fund an account in minutes over the Internet.•Client Portal.  A client portal allows your clients to go to your website and view information that might be of interest to them.  This information could include account balances, holdings, transactions, performance and various portfolio analytics.•Back Office Tools.  This category covers a wide range of tools that include portfolio model management, accounting, trading, rebalancing and billing.   At this point you may be thinking to yourself, “Wait a minute. I already have most, if not all of this functionality at my firm. There’s nothing new here. Why do I need robo technology at all?” You have just identified an important point. Robo technology is not so much about what you do, as it is about how you do it. Robo technology integrates many of the common tasks and processes that you have used at your firm for years. It makes them easier, quicker and more seamless. In the process, it helps you work more efficiently and enhances your clients’ experience. Another important point that is being missed by most firms is robo technology can be leveraged for serving both next generation clients and high-net-worth clients alike.      Complete Packaged Solutions. These offerings are as close to a full turn-key solution as you can get.  They provide a complete set of tools for engaging and onboarding clients, managing portfolios and handling your back office needs.  This version of robo can be white labeled so your firm is front and center and the robo provider is essentially invisible to your clients.  This is a great alternative if you like everything included in the packaged solution.  However, your ability to customize can be limited. The robo provider’s willingness to make changes in the basic program may be influenced by the size of your firm. So, for example, you may have to utilize a set of standard ETF portfolios offered by the robo provider rather than your own portfolios.Examples of firms that provide a complete packaged solution include Betterment Institutional and Upside who both offer pre-constructed ETF portfolios, and Trizic which allows you to use your own portfolios.    Front End or Back Office Only Solutions. Some providers only offer part of the robo functionality discussed above. These options work best if you are not looking for a complete package, but instead only want certain functionality that will work together with technology components that you already have in place.  An example of this type of firm is Jemstep. It provides front end robo technology, including client engagement and onboarding tools and a client portal, but does not provide back office tools. Jemstep works well for firms that already have portfolio management tools in place and allows advisors complete freedom to utilize their own investment management solutions.Other firms that provide slick front-end robo-technology are Oranj, Wealth Access and Circle Black. Each provides account aggregation and analysis tools for advisors and an online client portal. Wealthminder provides online financial planning tools that can be used alone by a prospective client or in consultation with an advisor.    An example of a firm that provides online back office tools is Orion. It provides a client portal, portfolio accounting, trading, performance reporting and billing services, but does not provide client engagement or onboarding tools. Orion’s cloud-based technology has allowed it to integrate with many of the most popular technology applications used by advisors today to create a suite of efficiency tools, enabling advisors to spend more of their time nurturing client relationships rather than dealing with operational issues.If you like Jemstep’s front-end capabilities and Orion’s back office tools you can have them both. These two firms have integrated their offerings so they work together seamlessly. Orion’s back office capabilities are also integrated with the robo, Autopilot which begins the front-end client experience with a gamified risk assessment powered by Riskalyze.Fully Customized, Build Your Own Solutions. If you’ve looked at the out-of-the-box robo offerings and still aren’t satisfied, you can roll up your sleeves and customize design your own. This can be accomplished by creating a suite of integrated technology offerings that either you already enjoy using or are on your wish list. The success of this model will be based on choosing a combination of cloud-based front and back end technologies that can “play together” well.For example, you can choose to form an integrated suite of one of the available best-in-class client portals, an e-signature company, your custodian and a robust portfolio management system. Depending on how elaborate your design is, in some cases you may need to hire a programmer to help pull it all together.Advisor Software is an example of a technology hub that provides the ability to custom-design your own robo offering. It has a wide variety of APIs (application programming interfaces) to choose from that can be used as building blocks for your solution.  Think of each API as a connection for each piece of your personal robo puzzle. For example, Advisor Software offers a risk tolerance questionnaire API, a portfolio analytics API, a performance analysis API, a rebalancer API and so forth. You select from the Advisor Software API menu and create the robo capabilities you want.    Tradier is a firm that is primarily focused on providing brokerage APIs to firms that want to develop online trading capabilities. But it also offers advisors the ability to build automated account opening, account funding and certain client portal capabilities into their websites.Building your own program obviously requires more thought and planning than buying an off-the-shelf solution. But it allows you to truly design your own robo from the ground up. It will take more time and effort, but the pay-off is you get exactly what you want.It is important to understand the nuances each option offers. Each one offers a different set of capabilities, look and feel, time-to-market and cost structure. Identify the features and functionalities you would want to create the best solution for you and your clients. Then match your needs with the model and offering that is the best overall fit for your firm.    ;Wealth Management;http://www.nasdaq.com/article/making-sense-of-robo-tools-for-advisors-cm530849
315;The Hong Kong Wealth Report 2015 wealth management market research says number of Hong Kong HNWIs is forecast to grow by 15.6%, to reach 231,186 in 2019, while HNWI wealth is projected to grow by 25.8% to reach US$1.4 trillion. Despite unfavorable world market conditions, the Hong Kong wealth management market is emerging. It is attractive not only to local developers but foreign institutions, as it holds substantial wealth resources. Core HNWIs - also called core millionaires - consist of two wealth bands: mid-tier millionaires and lower-tier millionaires. As their name implies, core millionaires are the base of the wealth pyramid, with 98.6% of Hong Kong HNWIs being identified as such. Core HNWIs collectively accounted for 60.9% of Hong Kong HNWI wealth in 2014, which is well below the global average of 70%;Wealth Management;
316;Looking to bring top-flight wealth management services to the middle class, FutureAdvisor has raised $15.5 million in fresh capital.The round was led by new investor Canvas with participation from the company’s previous investors including Sequoia Capital. Y Combinator, one of the country’s top accelerators, provided the initial boost for the company’s launch into the marketplace in September 2013.Unlike other wealth management tools like Betterment or Wealthfront, FutureAdvisor is catering to a different, less wealthy clientele.“We cater to the mass middle American market,” says chief executive Bo Lu matter-of-factly. “Our clients are people like airline pilots or military officers. These are people who are diligently saving for their long term financial future.”Unlike the other services, which are tackling a different price-point and type of user, typically tech-savvy and more wealthy, the classic client for FutureAdvisor has roughly $100,000 and multiple accounts with different institutions,” Lu says.In some ways, the FutureAdvisor service is similar to other offerings on the market, in that it uses algorithms to optimize the portfolio for a potential customer. It offers free services around portfolio optimization and the aggregation of investment data into a single source. Should a customer want FutureAdvisor to actually execute an investment strategy the company can do that — and indeed expects that service to provide a good chunk of its services.“We aggregate a single view across all accounts and advise on how best to optimize the portfolio. All of that is free,” says Lu.”We charge clients for the pay product when we become the day to day portfolio manager.”Typically a charge would be half of a percent in management fees that a client would pay FutureAdvisor.Investors who have tracked the wealth management space express some concern about whether these companies can get to profitability quickly enough to create venture-sized returns, but Lu says that despite low fees, there are billions of dollars to be made in wealth management. Put simply, asset appreciation alone creates tremendous value over time, and if a firm can lock in a large enough user base… that value could manifest itself sooner rather than later.Not only does FutureAdvisor monitor investments, it’s got an underlying agreement with TD Ameritrade and with Fidelity Investments act as custodians for a user’s portfolio.Lu said that the company would use the investment to double the size of its team, which he expects to grow from 20 employees to over 40 by the end of the year.Impressively, the company has grown its assets under management from $!3 million in September to $110 million today;Wealth Management;http://techcrunch.com/2014/05/21/wealth-management-startup-futureadvisor-raises-15-5-million/
317;"Melbourne-based robo-advice startup Clover has raised seed funding, led by a strategic investment from superannuation fund Equipsuper. The investment will see Equipsuper’s 50,000 customers get access to Clover’s robo-advice platform when it launches in mid-2016.Clover’s robo-advisor uses a goals-based approach to advise provision and portfolio construction. Those goals guide the algorithm so as to create portfolios that are periodically rebalanced in order to attain those goals.While other robo-advice startups are targeting consumers directly, Clover co-founder Harry Chemay says the startup’s enterprise focus, is a competitive advantage.“We’re under no disillusions that there will be others that go to market before and after us,” Chemay says.“Each will need a particular niche. Partnering with a 50,000 member super fund, we’ve built a tech we will allow them to use. But we’ll also be looking to licence it as well. We already have a point of difference.”Equipsuper chief executive officer Danielle Press says superannuation funds have no choice but to integrate fintech into their offerings.“We certainly do not intent to be left sitting on the sidelines as member demand for online enablement makes offering these services essential to surviving and thriving in the financial services sector,” Press saysOur involvement with Clover will enable us to extend the reach of our advice offering to members who would not seek it through more traditional advice channels.“We are confident it will appeal to younger people in the wealth-building space enabling them to personalise their investment portfolios to achieve their long-term goals. This demographic seldom seeks face-to-face financial advice.”It’s a demographic that Chemay and Clover believe is currently not being served well by financial services."" Australians should seek guidance on their personal finances earlier in life and not just when nearing retirement, but there are many barriers to this happening at present. It’s easier to order a pizza online and track its progress to your door than it is to set your financial goals online and track their progress to attainment,” he says.";Wealth Management;http://www.startupsmart.com.au/growth/clovers-robo-advisor-has-a-super-ally/2015092815599.html
318;"An analysis of mobile solutions for financial advisors concludes that applications to support client interaction and advisory services “will become one of the most industry-disruptive, but potentially most rewarding” developments in the wealth management sector.This is the main finding of Mobile Apps for Financial Advisors and Wealth Managers by Swiss research company MyPrivateBanking Research.“Existing mobile solutions for financial advisors show the potential for greatly improving the interaction between advisor and client by supplying real-time information, multi-media content and new ways of communication.” said Francis Groves, senior analyst at MyPrivateBanking. “This makes a real difference to client meetings and personal interaction between advisor and client that up until now has mainly been dominated by heaps of paper, often out-dated reports and portfolio data, with discussions of portfolios and performance where little scenario planning was possible.”The report looked at systems from Advent Black Diamond, Appway, Avaloq, Charles River Development, DST Systems; Finantix, Kony Solutions, MicroStrategy, PolarisFT and SunGard. It found that all demonstrated different aspects of good practice in solution design and four of the solutions were “not only well designed but had particular strengths in certain areas”.•Appway was commended for “outstanding support in winning new clients and complying with regulations across different jurisdictions”.•MicroStrategy’s mobile solutions are commended “for their highly customisable offerings with a comprehensive range of functions”. available;•PolarisFT is singled out for “incorporating excellent design features for financial planning and performance viewing”.•SunGard’s “focus on smaller wealth management businesses and very good use of mobile visualisation tools” gets it noticed by the report’s authors.But while each solution has unique strengths and features, “none have yet realised the full potential” of mobile apps. The design of most mobile solutions is still dominated by the legacy of the vendors’ main wealth management platforms, which run on PCs and desktop computers. The “potential for revolutionising advisor/client interactions can often be glimpsed but is not yet fully developed,” says the report.It sees three particular shortcomings in current offerings:•While these advisor solutions are generally rich in content and functionality, there is plenty of scope for developing their relevance to client meetings. For instance, six out of 10 vendors provide a comprehensive and detailed portfolio management system and five had good performance reporting capabilities but only four allowed an advisor to produce ad hoc reports.•Existing solutions “do an excellent job in helping advisors to carry lots of information into meetings but do less well when it comes to meeting dynamics”. Just one of the solutions researched evidenced a well-thought out meeting preparation component.•Report publishing and client contacting functions are “unnecessarily limited”. None of the solutions covered in the report provided the kind of full and flexible report publishing options, both for standard and ad hoc reports, that we would hope to see available to advisors in client meetings.";Wealth Management;http://www.bankingtech.com/75321/mobile-apps-will-boost-wealth-management-sector/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=mobile-apps-will-boost-wealth-management-sector

324;There’s an age old question in wealth management and investment advice: Man or Machine. Today the battle has begun.Over the last six years, a related segment of FinTech that has received a lot of attention, and a fair share of controversy, is automated investment services… or what are frequently called “robo advisors.”These technology-backed advisors were built on the premise that many of the activities performed by a Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) can be replicated by advanced intuitive software. They promise lower costs, simplicity and even the bonus potential of making investing “fun”.Already, robo-advisors like Betterment and Wealthfront have accomplished something that 99% of startups never do – turning an idea into a company that is growing, thriving, and has the chance to be a permanent fixture in its industry.In fact, the $4.7 trillion wealth management giant BlackRock just acquired FutureAdvisor, another robo advisor platform with $600 million under management;Wealth Management;http://www.forbes.com/sites/chancebarnett/2015/09/01/fintech-trends-wealth-management-and-the-rise-of-robo-advisors/
325;"BlackRock’s acquisition of US robo-adviser FutureAdvisor might seem a minuscule financial transaction for the world’s largest asset manager but it is a potentially huge deal for the wealth management industry.Fund managers, banks, brokers and financial advisers all face threats to their business models from robo-advisers, which provide automated online investment services.It is still a nascent industry but it is expanding fast. More than 200 robo-advice platforms now exist in the US and activity is also picking up in Europe where there has been a flurry of deals. Last year, Schroders acquired a stake in Nutmeg. And earlier this month, Aberdeen Asset Management bought Parmenion Capital Partners, which manages £1.5bn. Growth projections vary widely but assets managed via robo-advice could reach $5tn over the next decade, according to Citigroup, which believes the uptick will be fuelled by the growing wealth of younger, more tech-savvy investors.“Robo-advice poses a competitive threat that will increase as wealth passes from baby boomers to millennials,” says Citi analyst Haley Tam.The potential for further growth and the success already achieved by robo-advice pioneers, such as Betterment and Wealthfront, has caught the attention of some of the asset management industry’s largest players, including Fidelity, Charles Schwab and Vanguard. Fidelity announced partnerships last year with Betterment and LearnVest, while Charles Schwab has developed a low-cost ETF-based service. Vanguard is offering a hybrid model that still allows contact with human advisers, a model that has already gathered $21bn in assets. Unlike its competitors, BlackRock does not intend to build a consumer focused business. Instead it plans to use FutureAdvisor to partner with banks, insurance companies, broker-dealers and financial advisers to help them sell robo-advice. Robo-advisers mostly allocate client funds to low-cost ETFs or index funds and BlackRock is the world’s largest ETF provider. It has indicated it will expand this service to Europe. “Robo-advice is another factor pushing investors towards passive [funds] and away from traditional active management,” says Ms Tam. William Trout, a senior analyst with Celent, a consultancy, predicts robo-advice will have a “seismic impact” on the wealth management industry, resulting in big problems for much of the adviser community. But he and others believe wealthy investors will still demand face-to-face advice. Mr Trout adds: “Many retail investors are not entirely comfortable with handing over their assets to a computer and still need some hand-holding with a human adviser.” The push by asset managers into robo-advice also presents a threat to the operations of some of the biggest US banks that run large brokerages staffed by human advisers. Many of these brokerages focus on wealthier clients and will be reluctant to see their existing businesses cannibalised by low-cost robo-advice. But rumours are circulating of new partnerships forming such as those between Motif Investing and US Bank, SigFig and Bank of the West, and Trizic and JPMorgan.Realism is necessary, however. Jet Lali, head of digital at Alpha FMC, the consultancy, believes robo-advice is only in the infant stages of its development and will need to improve quickly. A basic questionnaire is generally used to determine asset allocation for a client but Mr Lali expects to see an exponential improvement in service standards, akin to the evolution of modern smartphones from early computers. He predicts the eventual development of highly personalised automated advice solutions that are “almost like a fingerprint”. These will be able to take a client’s mortgage and art collection into account to provide a total perspective on wealth. He also expects to see these more sophisticated advice services linked to bank, brokerage and tax services.Hill's firm, which manages nearly $4 billion in assets, is building out a technology platform to offer more services to existing clients and to potentially smaller investors who don't meet the firm's $1 million minimum threshold of assets. He's not doing it because he fears he'll lose clients to Web-based advisors charging a fraction of what he does, but because he expects technology to increasingly be the preferred means for people to access advisory services.The typical online advisory firm asks clients a series of questions about their finances, goals and tolerance for risk and, depending on the answers, recommends portfolios of funds, stocks and bonds. The portfolios can usually be automatically rebalanced for a little extra, but most of the websites don't have the means to offer significant tax-, estate- or insurance-planning services. Carl Domino, president and chief investment officer of Carl Domino—ranked ninth in CNBC's top fee-only advisor list—doesn't see the growing number of robo-advisors as a threat to his firm, which manages more than $282 million in assets for high-net-worth clients. ""I doubt that it's competition for us,"" he said. ""An investor with $2 [million] or $3 million doesn't want to just deal with a website. They hire someone else to worry about their money, so they can sleep at night.""Domino thinks the websites are, nevertheless, offering a valuable service for investors who might not otherwise get any help managing their finances. Like Hill at Halbert Hargrove, Domino is of the opinion that a little planning can go a long way toward helping people invest successfully. ""The trick to managing money is getting adequate diversification, keeping costs down and taking a systematic approach that doesn't change with views of the market,"" he said. ""It's not rocket science; it's discipline. ""If the websites are legitimate, it's a valuable service,"" Domino added.";Wealth Management;http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8832a6d4-5b05-11e5-a28b-50226830d644.html#axzz3ozzKQY37
326;"The dozens of Web-based advisory firms that have launched in the last decade don't seem like much of a threat to financial advisors. As a group, they have collected a small fraction of the assets managed by traditional advisors, and their client base of do-it-yourself investors and younger individuals with small amounts of assets are typically not the traditional advisor's target market, anyway. The so-called robo-advisors, however, are a force to be reckoned with.Their low-cost service delivery models and the increasingly sophisticated tools they offer to investors represent the future of the industry. Leaders of top wealth management firms may not see them as immediate threats, but they ultimately could have a major impact on the market for financial advice.""When you think of financial planning, 70 percent of it can be put on a piece of paper for the typical young family,"" said certified financial planner Russell Hill, chairman and CEO of registered investment advisor Halbert Hargrove, the second-highest-rated fee-only wealth manager in CNBC's recent Top 100 Fee-Only Wealth Management Firms list. ""The robo-advisors are going to put pressure on everybody in the industry and force advisors to demonstrate their value to clients.""";Wealth Management;http://www.cnbc.com/2014/06/18/robo-advisors-are-no-immediate-threat-wealth-managers-say.html
327;"""We're watching them, but we don't see them as competition at this point,"" said Mark Stadtlander, certified financial planner and CEO of Foster Group, a firm managing nearly $1.5 billion. Foster Group wasranked 13th on the CNBC list. ""People can answer questionnaires, and they can have portfolios built for them, but they can't get ongoing conversations about their future and what concerns them."" The element of human interaction remains a big competitive advantage for traditional advisors, say wealth management leaders. ""What's missing with most of these websites is experience and credentials,"" said Jana Shoulders, CEO and co-founder of Adams Hall Wealth Advisors, No. 6 on the CNBC list. ""They're designed for do-it-yourselfers, and it's great to have those resources available to people, but it's important to have the human component available as well. This is still a trust business."" Shoulders, too, thinks engaging people about their finances as they head toward retirement is a very good thing. Her firm has joined a collective effort spearheaded by Mariner Wealth Advisors to offer advisory services to clients without investment minimums. The resulting firm, FirstPoint Financial, was launched last year and charges 1.25 percent on assets up to $1 million. That's significantly higher than most of the online advisory websites, but FirstPoint also offers access to experienced financial advisors—in face-to-face meetings, if desired. ""Emerging affluent [investors] are sharp people. They see the need and value of good financial guidance,"" said Shoulders.From advisors' perspectives, the optimistic view of the robo-advisors is that they are expanding the market for financial advice. The planning tools and software algorithms they use to customize services for people who otherwise would not have access to them are helping investors make better decisions with their money. Best-case scenario: As those investors accumulate more assets, they will be more likely to seek out the robust financial planning services that a traditional advisor can offer.The more troubling possibility is that robo-advisors could undermine the economics of the advisory industry, just as discount brokers did to the brokerage industry and exchange-traded funds are doing to the asset management industry.  If millennials and the next generation of investors are comfortable getting their financial advice online, Web-based advisors could take a bigger share of the market in the future and put pressure on traditional advisors' fees and profit margins. At this point, leaders like Stadtlander at Foster Group aren't worried about that prospect. He believes the long-term relationships and holistic planning that advisors offer their clients can't easily be replicated strictly by Web-based offerings.

328;"Enormous progress is being made in the field of artificial intelligence, and the practical implications of this new technology are being felt in many areas of finance, but especially in wealth management. Can the distinctively traditional, highly personal private banks keep up with the robots? Silvia Pavoni investigates.Artificial intelligence (AI) is a much-discussed subject, and one that has engaged the minds of scientists and philosophers while at the same time inspiring the imaginations of writers and artists. Professor Nick Bostrom, head of the Future of Humanity Institute at the University of Oxford, predicts that the creation of human-like robots will lead to either utopia or extinction for humans; while in Ex Machina, film director Alex Garland hints at a romantically dark future where robots are set to outsmart people.More practically, AI has engaged the finance world too, where self-learning systems are already used to manage investments. Traditionally, wealth management has been associated with expensive, personalised face-to-face advice that only the richest members of society could benefit from. Now, with the growth of online platforms based on automated assessments of a user's risk appetite, and automated portfolio creation, services and products are offered with significantly lower fees, and can be accessed instantly by anyone with a laptop or smartphone – something proving particularly appealing to younger generations.And this is a phenomenon that potentially has wider consequences, as it mirrors a change in attitudes towards savings and investments in both developed and emerging markets. This is crucial at a time of creaking public finances and plummeting pension expectations.";Wealth Management;http://www.thebanker.com/Banking/Private-Banking/Are-robo-advisors-stealing-wealth-managers-clients?ct=true
329;"Wealth management is a sector that can easily leverage economic trends. Indeed, the mass affluent group – typically described as those with between $100,000 and $1m in disposable assets – and individuals with between $1m and $2m are forming the fastest growing and broadest wealth segment group in the world, according to data from US bank Citi. This group’s total wealth is predicted to grow from $88,000bn in 2015, to $145,000bn by 2020, with the largest growth estimated to come from emerging markets. Currently, the mass affluent the world over tend to be served by retail banks through standardised and often limited products. Personalisation is a trait of private banking services, usually reserved for wealthier clients.“Robo-advising is democratising wealth management,” says Francis Groves, senior analyst at Swiss research firm MyPrivateBanking, and co-author of a recent report on the subject, 'Robo-Advisers 2.0 – How automated investing is infiltrating the wealth management industry'. “Financial advice is rather expensive, so you need to be quite wealthy for the advice to be effective. Robo-advising fits in well with the spirit of the time, the zeitgeist of the decade: it is internet-based, accessible for people of the millennial generation, [and it reflects people’s] prudent attitude towards their finances,” adds Mr Groves.Robo-advising is gaining traction, with a growing number of robo-advisory firms popping up across the US, as well as in Europe, Canada, Australia and, more recently, Hong Kong. From the relatively well-established Wealthfront and Betterment in the US, to Nutmeg in the UK, Vaamo in Germany, MoneyFarm in Italy, 8 Now! in Hong Kong and Sydney-based Stockspot. In its recent report, research firm MyPrivateBanking has identified 14 firms active in this field, and more companies have either recently launched or are about to launch operations, with large venture capital flows being poured into the sector.The value of these robo-advisory firms is so broadly recognised that they have started to be included in corporate employee benefits packages; for instance, Google now offers free Wealthfront advice to staff. The appeal of robo-advising is rooted as much in its revolutionary technology as it is in demographic trends.“Many people think of the automated services revolution as purely about technology, but it is just as much about demographics – 60% of our clients are under 35,” says Adam Nash, Wealthfront’s chief executive. “For most of our clients, we are their first investment service, since our minimum is so low [$500], as is our management fee. The average wealth manager is more than 50 years old, and their clients are also over 50. They have built their business on the needs of the baby boomer generation.”Nutmeg’s co-founder, Nick Hungerford, adds: “Not many wealth managers are getting young customers. If banks do not improve in various segments of their business, slowly but surely newcomers such as Nutmeg will come and steal their profits.”";Wealth Management;http://www.thebanker.com/Banking/Private-Banking/Are-robo-advisors-stealing-wealth-managers-clients?ct=true
330;A robo-advisor is essentially an online firm that offers algorithm-based risk assessment, automated portfolio selection and automatic portfolio rebalancing. Thanks to their self-learning systems, these companies can enrol and assess clients, and provide them with investment strategies and products without the need of any human interaction. Their mantra is to keep the whole process simple, clear, personalised and inexpensive.Because of the automated nature of their work, new digital firms charge only a small fraction of the fees billed by private banks. Wealthfront charges 0.25% on portfolios of more than $10,000 and no charge at all for those amounting to less. Betterment has a sliding fee structure that goes no further than 0.35%, and is inversely related to the size of the portfolio. In the UK, Nutmeg’s fee scale goes from a maximum 1% for portfolios of less than £25,000 ($39,000), to 0.3% for those of more than £500,000. Crucially, across the robo-advisory world, investing $500 would get the same standard of advice that $5m portfolios would get.Fees across the whole sector tend to be low, and their structure extremely clear. In contrast, fees for traditional wealth managers are not as clearly broken down and ultimately add up to significantly higher figures. This is particularly true in the UK, according to many in the sector.One way that robo-advisors have cut costs, allowing them to offer such low fees, is by putting paid to the assumption that interpersonal connection is essential to wealth management: they see their own real estate simply as a cost rather than as an asset. Nutmeg’s chief product officer, Scott Eblen, says: “We are based in a totally unremarkable street in an unremarkable building: this makes a big difference [to cost].” Further, these new wealth managers attract exactly the technical brains needed to develop the needed technology, who might otherwise view banking as an uninspiring sector.“Coming from Google, [I know that] there’s a hesitation for tech people to go work for a bank, while a start-up sounds more appealing,” says Mr Eblen. “So, for the creative types, the designers, the engineers, there’s something more appealing about joining Nutmeg, where there’s so much potential to change people’s lives for the better. [Tech types] don’t necessarily see this in a bank, even if a bank aspires to do that.”;Wealth Management;http://www.thebanker.com/Banking/Private-Banking/Are-robo-advisors-stealing-wealth-managers-clients?ct=true
331;What does this mean for private banks? At the end of 2014, the world’s assets managed or administered by investment professionals amounted to $9200bn, according to estimates by consultancy Deloitte. The $20bn that robo-advisors will manage by the end of this year, according to MyPrivateBanking, is a small fraction of the total. Even if growing fast, the $450bn it may reach in the next five years remains a small sliver of the whole wealth management cake.The real threat, say many, is in the speed at which people’s preferences, expectations and attitudes towards technology and banking are changing when it comes to managing their money. Private banks may not be able to keep up, due to their heavy regulatory burden, legacy technology issues and, in some cases, damaged reputations. If demographic trends are long in the making and easily predictable, the demands of the new generations may indeed require faster reaction times by incumbents. Should they fail to adapt, established names and their business models risk becoming obsolete or redundant.Furthermore, capturing today’s mass affluent individuals would likely lock down the richer clients of the future. The rich clients of the present, however, continue to absorb private banks’ attention.When private banks do serve affluent clients, perhaps family members of wealthier individuals, the level of profitability of the smaller segment is rather high, points out Boston Consulting Group (BCG) in its 'Winning the growth game' survey. According to BCG data, in developed countries, wealth managers’ average margin in the mass affluent segment is 122 basis points – which means that the bank makes $122 for every $10,000 invested. This compares with 80 basis points for clients owning between $1m and $20m, and 39 basis points for clients with disposable assets of over $20m. However, the survey points out that private banks do not want to “over-serve” mass affluent people at the expense of their increasingly demanding main high-net-worth market. Greater focus, lower fees and the more personalised approach that robo-advisors offer to affluent clients are understandably welcome;Wealth Management;http://www.thebanker.com/Banking/Private-Banking/Are-robo-advisors-stealing-wealth-managers-clients?ct=true
332;"As private banks centre their attention on the demands of the wealthy, much of the innovation disrupting investment management is taking place outside of the market. And this, some argue, is putting traditional wealth managers on the defensive. “Let me be clear, we do not refer to ourselves as a 'robo advisor', nor do our clients. This is a term created by the traditional industry, in an attempt to undermine our value,” says Mr Nash. He adds that Wealthfront, which now oversees $2.25bn of assets, defines itself as an automated investment service.While they might belittle these innovative new offerings, most large banks are, however, trying to breed similar innovation through incubators. UBS’s chief operating officer for wealth management, Dirk Klee, says: “If you look at our innovation centres, one in Zurich, one in London, one coming up in Singapore now and possibly other places in the future – maybe in China or Israel – we provide those spaces to innovative people who don’t want to work in a bank environment. We give them a challenge: to come up with an idea to solve a digital issue that we face as a bank.”Mr Klee also points out that automation would also help narrow the gap between demand for advice and the limited numbers of good advisors in the market. “There are only so many highly trained client advisors that you find in the market, and technology can help you spread your know-how over a larger population, including affluent clients,” he says.But while such centres have potential, the ability of a large, traditional wealth management institution to adapt to these new innovations is often lacking. Mr Eblen cites a specific case in which an established wealth manager had created an independent automated investment solution. “[It was] half there in terms of creating a great customer experience, and then the company's legal department [must have] got involved and put all the traditional boiler plates on top of the clean-cut product,"" he says.""Even just the basic sign up process: if you explain the legal terms or conditions of the product in plain English, that’s a lot more appealing to people. [Otherwise] people assume that it is a traditional product skinned in something that only appears to be new,” adds Mr Eben.Mr Groves shares a similar view, saying: “Robo-advising works if the website is very simple. And they all look very simple and are dedicated to one function: enrolling clients. [It has to be] uncluttered, easy for people to understand. This is an advantage compared with [traditional] wealth managers, particularly if the wealth manager is linked to a retail bank. Banks’ websites are like big supermarkets, everything is on there. Robo-advisors’ websites are more like ice-cream parlours: you go there with the clear objective of getting an ice-cream and that’s what you find.”";Wealth Management;http://www.thebanker.com/Banking/Private-Banking/Are-robo-advisors-stealing-wealth-managers-clients?ct=true
333;"Nonetheless, innovative projects that see traditional wealth managers aiming to create an automated, independent service, either internally or by joining forces with a robo-provider, are generally seen as a positive development. In the US, Charles Schwab’s Schwab Intelligence Portfolio was indeed welcomed by the market. As was brokerage and custody house Fidelity Institutional Wealth Services’s partnership with robo-advisors Betterment and LearnVest.Similar developments and partnerships are under way in emerging markets, too. In Singapore, DBS Bank is using technology firm IBM’s cognitive computing solutions, which include the first cognitive computer, Watson, to improve the financial advice that it gives to its affluent clients. More is to come, according to BCG’s Singapore-based partner Federico Burgoni. “[Algorithm-based services] are driving digital expansion. I have two clients that are launching [an AI platform in Asia]; they’re between eight to 16 months away,” he says.Mr Burgoni stresses the current relevance of investment services in the region’s banking market, where the expansion of the mass affluent classes has stirred local lenders into action. While revenues on assets on services to clients worth more than $1m is about 100 basis points, the figure goes up to about 160 basis points in Asia for banks serving mass affluent people – these are mainly local retail banks or regional specialists with strong physical presence, such as Standard Chartered or HSBC, he notes.“Private banking [for high-net-worth individuals] has always been offshore only – so if you had lots of money, this money was offshore, in Singapore or Hong Kong, and managed by the big guys, such as UBS or Credit Suisse,” says Mr Burgoni. “With the emergence of the affluent segment, this is changing; that money is now managed onshore. So if you are an affluent Malaysian, you would have your [investment] account with Maybank, locally. Onshore wealth management has doubled over the past five years. This is the hot topic of the moment; there isn’t one single local bank that is not interested in wealth management right now.”Similarly, online firms offering account aggregation are popping up in Latin America, and are starting to think about possible expansions into online investment platforms, such as GuíaBolso in Brazil or MoneyMenttor in Mexico.";Wealth Management;http://www.thebanker.com/Banking/Private-Banking/Are-robo-advisors-stealing-wealth-managers-clients?ct=true
334;More developments ought to come out of developed markets, too, from dealing more effectively and securely with issues such as client identity, to expanding robo-advisory to the retiring baby boomers. The ability to connect to an investment provider from a well-populated, high-profile LinkedIn account or a verified Twitter account, for example, could be considered better proof of identity than a passport, which can be easily forged, especially in its digital copy, says Mr Eblen.Mr Eblen also imagines solutions where investment accounts are seamlessly integrated in to peoples' everyday lives. So, as an investor starts researching mortgage rates online and maybe also properties to buy, their portfolio could seamlessly adapt on the assumption that they would need to make a large cash payment for a house deposit in a few months time. The pensions market is also packed with business opportunities. Mr Nash points to investment firms such as Vanguard in the US, which is successfully bringing its tech-assisted advisor model to pensioners. This market is set to flourish in the UK, too. From April 2015, UK investors have been free to take any amount of cash from their defined contribution pensions – funds to which both employee and employer contribute – with no obligation to buy an annuity. This is a drastic departure from a market which had been accustomed to caps on withdrawals and information on the fund’s value typically being released on an annual basis only – a market which innovative firms are now looking at very closely.;Wealth Management;http://www.thebanker.com/Banking/Private-Banking/Are-robo-advisors-stealing-wealth-managers-clients?ct=true
335;"Robo-advising is a small phenomenon compared with the size of the traditional wealth management sector. Unsurprisingly, many remain unconvinced that human interaction may become superfluous when managing people’s money. Indeed, given the option, most people would double check with a specialist fellow human if in doubt. “If you wake up with a headache in the morning you can punch in ‘headache’ on Google, get 20 million links and probably find out what you have; but you’d still call a doctor,” says Mr Klee. Indeed, 90% of UBS’s ultra-high-net-worth clients prefer personal interaction, he notes.This sentiment is echoed by Michael Benz, chief executive for wealth management at Standard Chartered, who does see a future where technology will play a larger role in wealth management, particularly in the emerging markets, but he says that this will not replace good human advice.Not all potential investors can afford good human advice, however, while the automated kind is becoming increasingly available. “[People who enjoy] the experience of fancy lunches and nice offices would tend to gravitate towards more traditional institutions, but as there is greater transparency about costs, people will generally move more towards tech solutions,” says Mr Eblen. “I think that wealth managers [are following the fate of] travel agents: 15 or 20 years ago people assumed they had to go out and find someone to [book a holiday]. Now they realise that they can do it themselves, get better value and do everything online.”";Wealth Management;http://www.thebanker.com/Banking/Private-Banking/Are-robo-advisors-stealing-wealth-managers-clients?ct=true
336;BlackRock Inc.  said Wednesday it is purchasing FutureAdvisor, a privately held pioneer in the fast-growing business of using automated computer models to build and manage investment portfolios.The terms of the deal, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter, weren’t disclosed. BlackRock said the financial effect isn’t material.With over $600 million in assets under management, FutureAdvisor will continue to serve both existing and new individual clients from its offices in San Francisco. But BlackRock is most interested in selling FutureAdvisor’s automated advisory services to the banks, securities firms and insurance companies that are customers of BlackRock Solutions. That unit, which accounted for $161 million of BlackRock’s $2.9 billion in revenue in the second quarter, sells a system that allows financial institutions to place trades and assess how those trades will affect their portfolios’ risk profiles, among other features.The service will be branded FutureAdvisor Powered by BlackRock Solutions.“FutureAdvisor as a website providing digital advice will continue to be there,” said  Robert Goldstein, chief operating officer and global head of BlackRock Solutions, in an interview. But as BlackRock looks “to grow the company, our focus is going to be on working with our partners.”“A lot of our interest was sparked by our clients coming to us” and asking for help serving investors who haven’t amassed enough in savings to meet the investment minimums required to work with a financial adviser, Mr. Goldstein said.When an individual investor goes to FutureAdvisor’s website and answers a questionnaire that, among other things, asks when he or she plans to retire, the service recommends a portfolio of index funds. For a 0.5% annual fee, the firm makes the recommended trades and its computer model automatically monitors and rebalances the portfolio. Do-it-yourself investors can get investment recommendations alone free.Mr. Goldstein said securities firms have expressed interest in offering the service to investors with smaller accounts that they serve through a centralized office staffed by telephone representatives rather than through individual advisers. The brokerages have also expressed interest in using such a platform “to enable financial advisers to be more efficient about handling mass-affluent” clients, typically viewed as those with less than $1 million in assets, he adds.FutureAdvisor will continue to use exchange-traded funds from BlackRock as well as investments from other companies. Clients may decide to customize the product, for example by using their own asset-allocation models, said Mr. Goldstein.The deal follows recent acquisitions of robo-advisory firms by companies including Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co. In March, Northwestern bought privately held LearnVest Inc. of New York for an undisclosed sum. The goal was to secure LearnVest’s planning tools for Northwestern’s agents.FutureAdvisor ranks fifth in assets under management among 12 robo-adviser startups tracked by Boston research firm Aite Group LLC. At the top of the list are Betterment LLC and Wealthfront Inc., each of which oversees about $2.6 billion for investors.This list doesn’t include Vanguard Group and Charles Schwab Corp., which recently launched services that provide online advice coupled with access to individual financial advisers. Vanguard had $22 billion in assets in that service at the end of June, according to the firm.Sophie Schmitt, a senior analyst at Aite, projects assets managed by robo-advisers and traditional firms with online offerings will reach $50 billion to $60 billion this year, up from $29 billion now and $16 billion at the end of 2014. That is still a small piece of the $19 trillion U.S. wealth advisers manage, according to Aite.;Wealth Management;http://www.wsj.com/articles/blackrock-embraces-robo-finance-advice-with-acquisition-of-futureadvisor-1440594106
337;The wealth management industry finds itself at a critical juncture as the threat from robo-advisers grows. A recent report from Deloitte, Robo-Advisors: capitalizing on a growing opportunity, underlines how this new breed of wealth management firm has started to steal assets from the big incumbents in the US. These robo firms include the likes of Betterment, Personal Capital and Wealthfront, which offer clients advice through digital interfaces for very low fees (on average 20 basis points). According to the report, assets under management at the 11 leading US robo-advisers hit $19 billion (£12.3 billion) at the end of 2014 , a 65% increase on the previous 12 months. In relative terms this is just a fraction of the $25 trillion of investable assets in the US, with the lack of distribution capabilities among robo firms limiting their reach. However, Deloitte points out this could be about to change with large US wealth management firms now joining the fray, including Charles Schwab and Vanguard, which are spending heavily on their digital propositions. Developments in the US should serve as a warning for traditional UK wealth managers to take the digital threat seriously.While Nutmeg and Strawberry Invest have captured the UK public’s imagination, the UK’s major wealth firms have been generally slow to respond to this threat. There are signs this is changing though, with Charles Stanley Direct now through £1 billion and Investec Wealth and Investment, Brewin Dolphin, Towry and Sanlam all investing in their digital strategies. Five major disruptive forces The Deloitte report highlighted five ways in which robo advice will disrupt the wealth management industry. 1: Lower fees 'The significantly lower fees (and in some cases zero fees) compared to traditional fees has broadened the market for advice to include the majority chunk of untapped wealth in the United States.'  2: The new generation 'Robo-advice plays into the common preferences of a new generation of wealth (i.e. more in control, digitally savvy, anywhere/anytime, etc...). 'Further, robo advice is influencing how many baby boomers and seniors purchase and consume wealth services, thereby challenging human-based business models that typically have higher fees.' 3: Personalisation 'Some wealth management firms are investing heavily in big data and advanced analytics, potentially broadening the range of advice that can be developed through algorithms and delivered digitally (beyond portfolio allocation and plain vanilla investment products). In other words, robo-advice can become more personalised and specific over time.'  Hybrid models 'Many leading wealth management firms are already working on incorporating robo-advice capabilities within their existing advisory offerings to create hybrid models (science and human-based) that can help increase value for clients across the wealth spectrum.' Barriers to entry 'Technology has lowered barriers to entry for new firms to break into wealth management. Both financial and non-financial services firms can take advantage, bringing new levels of competition and innovation to the industry.' Three solutions These threats are more likely to impact firms which serve a mass affluent client base, rather than those that serve a more select customer, who have a more complex set of financial planning needs. Deloitte believes wealth managers can meet this challenge in three ways. The accountancy firm list partnering with a robo-adviser as one of these viable solutions.  'Partnering with an existing robo-advisor can enable traditional firms to react quickly and typically has lower costs and limited organisational changes,' Deloitte said.  'It can also deliver complementary and promptly-realised advantages through process automation, cost reduction and the attraction of new customers.' Deloitte also reckons wealth firms should explore developing in-house solutions. 'Another way traditional advisors can effectively respond to the robo-advisor opportunity is by developing an in-house platform for both existing clients and new investors,' it said.  'This enables advisors to promote it as a low-cost alternative to traditional advisory services and provides the flexibility to offer varying functionality to help attract new investors.' Finally, it suggests the acquisition of a robo-advice firm could be an answer to the problem. 'When acquiring a robo-advisor, firms should identify a target firm based on a growing customer base, opportunities for further growth, technology capabilities and the potential “fit” within their organisation.' Ultimately, Deloitte expects digital automated advice to become the standard expectations for the mass-affluent segments of wealth management. And it believes we have only just seen the ‘tip of the iceberg’ in the development of this brand of wealth firm. ‘Big data and advanced analytics have the potential to broaden the scope of robo advice dramatically, incorporating financial planning into broader retirement, health, and wellbeing, and enabling quasi institutional research,’ Deloitte highlighted. ‘Robo-advice could then impact all investor segments, not just the mass-market and mass affluent retail investors. Robo-advice is here to stay and poised to evolve into much more disruptive and wide-ranging forms of advice. All wealth management firms should take notice.’;Wealth Management;http://citywire.co.uk/wealth-manager/news/robo-wars-5-big-disruptive-threats-facing-wealth-firms/a831640
338;For those who are unfamiliar, Betterment is one of the largest online investment services available. What makes Betterment unique is that their system is completely automated. Essentially, you have the option of setting up your investing preferences and letting Betterment’s software do the rest. The fees are low, between 0.15% and 0.35%, and are based on the amount of money you have invested in your accounts.For example, after completing your investor profile, you can fund your account on a monthly basis through automatic withdrawals from your bank account. Betterment then automatically invests that money for you. They’ll choose any number of low-cost exchange traded funds (ETFs) in which to invest, and they base it on your personal goals and time horizon. Additionally, Betterment will keep an eye on portfolio drift and automatically rebalance your accounts when needed. You can also set up your account to automatically reinvest dividends, putting the investing process completely on autopilot.According to Betterment’s research, 60-70% of people don’t keep track of their monthly cashflow. This means that many people are either overspending or oversaving with their budget. While saving money in any form is a good thing, keeping too much money in a bank account can lead to thousands of dollars in lost interest opportunity over an extended period of time. So, keeping with its theme of automated investing, Betterment has introduced a way to solve that problem: SmartDepsoit. With SmartDeposit, Betterment customers have all the tools they need to automatically invest their savings overages. When you enroll in SmartDeposit and link your bank account, these overages will automatically be withdrawn and invested by SmartDeposit once your account balance crosses a minimum threshold. You get to determine that threshold by using the “Checking Account Ceiling” feature. This gives you the flexibility of keeping your checking account balance above a preset amount while still taking advantage of potentially higher returns through investing your savings overages.;Wealth Management;http://www.doughroller.net/investing/betterment-smartdeposit-auto-pilot-for-savers/
339;"With markets in a state of unending flux, clients are showing they want more control and transparency around their wealth. Historically large banks have regulated and siloed financial advisors so that clients require multiple touch points to maintain a diversified portfolio. With low interest rates and the threat of an impending Fed rate raise, wealth managers will have to create new solutions to better mitigate volatility in the markets. For large financial institutions, it's harder than ever to innovate and restructure around new solutions. That's why robo-advisors are growing in the place of traditional wealth advisors. They are taking out the middleman and giving clients a more streamlined, transparent, and affordable solution to managing their wealth.Betterment is a robo-advisor with over 100,000 customers and $2.5 billion in assets under management. It is automating investing and eliminating third-party gatekeepers at a fraction of the cost of traditional wealth managers. Betterment is becoming a ""full-stack"" provider, acting as a plan's record-keeper, custodian, third-party administrator, and fiduciary advisor at essentially no added fee to the client. Many argue that automation only goes so far and that a human touch is still valuable. Even then, traditional advisors will have to do more to justify their cost with a slew of new technologies flooding the market. Why is Betterment winning? It is moving quickly and introducing new products serving both sides of the market. Betterment recently launched an institutional product that enables registered investment advisors to quantify the value of their services and add a wrap fee. Also, it recently introduced the first robo-advisory platform for 401(k) sponsors and participants -- radically disrupting how retirement plans have always worked. In addition to Betterment's main robo-advisory platform, these new technology solutions are redefining decades-old practices and will continue to shape wealth management in the U.S.  While many banks theoretically have the money to build their own system to seamlessly integrate into their current platforms, it's seems likely that they will not be able to compete against the rapid evolving new leaders in the market. Acquisition will be the key to survival. Last month BlackRock  bought FutureAdvisor, the fifth largest robo-advisory firm. All eyes are now on Betterment and the other leading competitor, Wealthfront, as the next acquisition targets.

340;When Betterment recently rolled out the first robo-advisory platform for 401(k) sponsors and participants, CEO and co-founder Jon Stein fired several shots across the bow of the 401(k) industry’s largest service providers, and its cadre of independent RIA fiduciaries.“We think what we’ve built is how all retirement plans should work, and someday will,” Stein told BenefitsPro.He also said the advice offered through Betterment’s automated platform, which is modeled on the low-cost ETF offerings already marketed to retail investors, will deliver an extent of “holistic” retirement guidance that participants “very rarely” get under the existing RIA model.Participants will have access to managed account-like automated rebalancing, with assets allocated to a predetermined risk-profile tailored to specific savings needsBut they won’t be paying managed account prices, said Stein. Sponsors with less than $1 million in assets won’t be charged upfront fees.Participants in mega plans with over $1 billion in assets will pay as little as 10 basis points, and fees won’t exceed 60 basis points on assets in any plan.Those are eye-catching price points. The latest edition of the 401(k) Averages Book, published February 2015, shows participants in small plans with less than $2.5 million in assets pay an average of 144 basis points.The same plan under Betterment’s platform would pay 60 basis points in fees—what plans with under $10 million in assets will be charged, according to a chart on Betterment’s website.;Wealth Management;http://www.benefitspro.com/2015/09/21/stakeholders-respond-to-betterments-launch

Fleming, senior vice president with BOK Financial Corp. (NASDAQ: BOKF), wealth management has come to include a great deal of institutional investment management, mineral management, and the more traditional retirement funds, such as 401(k) plans for both individuals and employers. Perhaps more importantly, the service offerings have boosted the bank's footprint in nearby Phoenix.""We really ramped up the last two years [in Phoenix] and are planning to add more staff. We already have a salesperson there. We've found that a lot of financial companies are packing up and leaving Phoenix, but we feel it's a good market to be in,"" she said. While the bank has offered some form of wealth management for decades, it has seen an increase in clients that want the whole package — banking services and wealth management — instead of segregated services and providers, so it customizes its offerings to specific client needs and provides financial education to said clients.Furthermore, the bank has seen an increased demand from tribal organizations, as well as those with oil and gas properties, for wealth management services.Fleming said that BOK Financial's total wealth management footprint currently spans $50 billion.While banks offering wealth management services isn't something new, a growing number of banks are competing with financial planning firms and other other companies.

344;"The future is upon us-or at least it certainly feels that way for those of us that lived through the 1980s. We have now passed, or are fast approaching, the apocalyptic dates prophesied by many of the decade’s classic sci-fi flicks. It is now three years since The Terminator’s Skynet launched an all-out nuclear assault on humanity. It is this year that Marty and Doc Brown arrive Back to the Future. And in just four years we are scheduled to find ourselves in the grim, dystopic nightmare envisioned in Blade Runner.OK, so it didn’t quite turn out how some imagined. 2020 is unlikely to be a world of killer robots or flying cars. But it has changed dramatically since the 1980s (e.g. the Internet), and 2020 will present a vastly changed landscape for individuals and businesses alike. A recent report from PwC (‘Asset Management 2020: A Brave New World’) casts a speculative eye forward to look at the very different environment asset managers will likely be facing in just half a decade’s time. Some of the key takeaways have profound implications for wealth managers, specifically the challenges and issues they face in ensuring their brands remain relevant in 2020.Talkin’ ‘bout my generation“Between 2010 and 2020, more than one billion more middle-class consumers will emerge globally, representing the largest single decade increase in customers in history. This increasing affluence will fuel the need for financial products for a young and growing constituency.” – PwC, ‘Asset Management 2020: A Brave New World’Let’s start with the good news. The world is due for a huge rise in the volume of Assets under Management (AUM) over the next half-decade. The report forecasts that total AUM will exceed $100 trillion by 2020, from around $64 trillion today. Of particular relevance for wealth managers are the predicted AUM from high net worth individuals (about $77 trillion) and the mass affluent ($100 trillion) – each doubling from their respective 2004 levels. The report speculates that over the same period, the asset management industry will increase its share of these AUM from 10% to almost half.Yet this doesn’t simply mean more of the same – far from it. The make-up of the pool of money, and the typical clients wealth managers will be chasing after, will change dramatically.For a start, wealth managers will need to adapt their models to the generational shift these numbers imply. Currently wealth managers primarily service the post-war baby boom generation. But by 2020 a considerable number of new clients will hail from the millennial generation. The younger portion of this generation will have no memory whatsoever of a pre-Internet age, and those older ones that have will have grown up accustomed to text messaging and video communication. This will only be exacerbated by the fact that those developing economies expected to give rise to a large new middle class tend to have younger populations.Engaging with these customers will be a vastly different proposition to engaging with their parents and grandparents. Their primary, habitual means of gathering information will not be traditional, common-denominator adverts or news, but rather various social media networks and specialist applications. They will be used to, and expect, information to be presented in a dynamic, interactive manner that allows them to quickly access the detail they want. And that detail must be instantly relevant and tailored to their individual circumstances. They will have little patience for delays or disconnects between the systems they use to organise their lives.This means that wealth managers are going to have to get serious about embracing technology to survive – no small challenge, given that today’s wealth management industry is distinctly low tech relative to others in the financial services space. But it’s not just a matter of digitisation, or creating an app. Wealth managers will need to ensure that touch-points between their organisation and clients are more numerous, more in-depth, and spread more evenly across the whole process. Much traditional wealth management is anchored around face-to-face meetings with an expert adviser, which may not be that regular. But this mode of communication will be less important and less convenient – and certainly not enough on its own – for the younger clients of tomorrow, who are growing up in a world of automated consumerism.This also raises the question of how to convey faceless expertise in communication. Expertise is at the heart of wealth management; it is essentially the product being sold. Yet traditionally this expertise has been bound up with individuals, via in-person relationships with clients. While this will no doubt remain important, the future need for continual, digital communication with clients via multiple channels will render it impractical for individuals alone to carry the ‘expertise’ aspect of the brand. Wealth managers of 2020 will be doing a lot more communicating with clients than at current. Much of it will be depersonalised text and images, and it will be crucial that the brand’s expertise runs right through these.On top of this, the level and type of engagement should be determined to some extent by the client. The customer will expect to be able to customise their experience according to their own needs. Options available to potential clients will need to run all the way from a once-a-year letter containing a simple, passive portfolio update, right through to daily advice and information via an app, recommending strategies and funds and highlighting information based on the client’s broader data habits.Made to measure“Asset management is a virtual business, but operates within a relatively low-tech infrastructure. By 2020, technology will have become mission critical to drive customer engagement.” -PwC, ‘Asset Management 2020: A Brave New World’The PwC report includes an illustration of a customer interaction in 2020 that neatly highlights some of these challenges. A young Chinese woman, Wei, checks a dating app on her mobile device. The dating company has a sister investment company, and the app automatically matches her dating preferences to an ideal financial strategy, suggesting a selection of appropriate funds. Wei is able to select a fund, which then plays a video detailing key information about it. A simple touch later and she has invested via her mobile account. What this example shows is that it’s not just a matter of embracing new channels (apps, video) but also ensuring those channels link up with the wider informational ecosystem in a way that can drive business.While this level of targeted advertising may take some older users aback as invasive, younger consumers are accustomed to it. The next generation of investors will expect asset managers to be able to communicate with them in a seamless fashion that shows a familiarity with their interests and aspirations.This trend toward tailored services and communications, combined with a larger, more diverse audience, will greatly enhance the importance of in-depth customer profiling to drive engagement. Technology – specifically access to a broad range of data, as in the illustration – will be crucial to achieving this. The wealth management sector today has the financial expertise, but is not particularly data rich. And who is great at customer profiling, with reams of data stored about their clients, their interests and obsessions? Technology firms such as Google and Facebook are data-rich but lack financial expertise. This raises the natural prospect of collaborations and mergers. This in turn has communications implications beyond engaging with clients and prospects, namely it’s a question of how to make your firm attractive to a potential partner in the tech space?The entrance of technology players into the market will make competition much fiercer. By 2020 wealth managers will have to stand out from the crowd to survive and thrive. The days of the generic, generalist wealth manager may be numbered for all but the largest firms. Wealth managers of 2020 will need to hone their specialist credentials and have a clearer idea of just who they are targeting and why. This could mean specialising in servicing a narrower market segment, and/or specialising in certain regions, markets, asset classes or investment approaches. And this of course will have big implications for how a firm markets and expresses itself.So it’s time to change. The clients of tomorrow will remember how you communicate with them today – it is never too early to begin establishing your name as a trusted partner for handling assets.";Wealth Management;http://marketsmedia.com/new-generation-technology-priorities-wealth-management-2020/
345;Bank of America Corp.’s “thundering herd” of Merrill Lynch financial advisers is about to be joined by a robot.The firm has put dozens of employees to work on an automated investment prototype for Merrill Edge, which targets accounts under $250,000, according to two people with knowledge of the project. Bank of America intends to unveil the service next year, said the people, who asked not to be identified speaking about company plans.Banks view robo-advisers, which use algorithms to provide investment advice online and with little or no human contact, as a disruptive technology that can help attract younger investors before they get hooked on a competitor’s platform. Executives at Morgan Stanley, which owns the U.S. brokerage with the most human advisers, and Wells Fargo & Co. have recently said they would develop or acquire a robo-adviser.“That is a real threat to our business, because we are disproportionately full-service, high-value-added, person-to-person activity, which isn’t for everybody,” John Shrewsberry, Wells Fargo’s chief financial officer, said in June. “There’s generations of tomorrow’s investors coming up today who may be more attracted to something less person-to-person and more technologically enabled.”Bank of America sees an opportunity “for a robo-advised offering that could complement the advice and guidance offered by our financial solutions advisers,” said Anne Pace, a company spokeswoman.;Wealth Management;http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-06/a-money-managing-robot-is-about-to-join-bofa-s-thundering-herd
346;Startups that popularized robo-advice include Betterment LLC, which launched in 2010 at a TechCrunch Disrupt conference in New York, and Silicon Valley-based Wealthfront Inc. Users, who tend to be high earners under the age of 50, provide their risk tolerance, age, income and goals online or through a mobile app. Algorithms suggest investments, usually in a basket of low-cost exchange-traded funds, and regularly rebalance the portfolio and realize losses for the sake of tax efficiency.Without human advisers -- people are the biggest expense at any securities firm -- the new ventures can charge annual fees of 0.5 percent of assets under management or less. That undercuts full-service brokers, which typically charge annual fees of at least 1 percent. On a $100,000 investment, the difference could mean more than $50,000 in savings over 20 years, given the same annual returns. The gap can widen further because the ETFs used by robo-advisers are cheaper than most mutual funds sold by humans.“The difference in cost to the consumer is so significant that it can’t be ignored,” Bob Hedges, a partner at consulting firm A.T. Kearney, said in an interview.The industry has seen dramatic growth, from almost zero in 2012 to a projected $300 billion in assets under management at the end of next year, according to a June report from A.T. Kearney. This year alone, Betterment almost tripled its assets to $3 billion. Robo-advisers could manage $2.2 trillion by 2020, the report said.;Wealth Management;http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-06/a-money-managing-robot-is-about-to-join-bofa-s-thundering-herd
347;“The robo-advice tool, which is an asset-allocation tool, is kind of taking common sense and putting it into a very user-friendly model,” Morgan Stanley Chief Executive Officer James Gorman said this week during the New York Times Dealbook conference. “If places like us don’t have that capability, we should have that capability, whether we build or buy, we should have it.”Mutual fund companies including Charles Schwab Corp. and Vanguard Group Inc. already have created their own automated offerings, and BlackRock Inc. said it bought FutureAdvisor in August.Merrill Lynch’s 14,563 full-service advisers -- who typically manage clients with more than $250,000 in investments -- are among the most productive in the industry, bringing in more than $1 million dollars each in revenue annually. Bank of America, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, has $2.4 trillion in client assets, the most of any U.S. bank. In 2010, it started Merrill Edge, a discount brokerage that targets clients on the lower end of the wealth spectrum and now manages $117 billion for 2 million customers.As low-cost providers take a larger percentage of the wealth-management industry’s total pie, revenues will fall by as much as $12 billion by 2020, according to the A.T. Kearney report. The ranks of financial advisers will shrink as consumers switch to robots and some human brokers adopt robo-tools to become more productive, Hedges said.For their part, bank executives don’t think virtual advisers will replace many people anytime soon. Higher-net-worth clients need estate planning, advice on taxes or complicated financial arrangements that algorithms can’t handle. Like a luxury carmaker offering an inexpensive base model, robo-service can be a gateway to the firm’s pricier offerings.“Some will flourish with the change, and others will struggle,” Hedges said. “What’s unfolding is a broad repricing of what financial advice costs.”;Wealth Management;http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-06/a-money-managing-robot-is-about-to-join-bofa-s-thundering-herd
348;"The wealth-management products that banks sell at branches across China are often considered as safe as deposits by customers. There are growing reasons to question that faith.The ability of Chinese lenders’ $2.4 trillion of WMPs to generate the returns they promise is being undermined as monetary easing has pushed corporate bond yields to a five-year low. Loath to lose market share by advertising weaker performance, managers of the funds have been adding leverage, extending maturities and buying higher-yielding notes that are rarely traded, according to consultancy CNBenefit and HSBC Holdings Plc.""A large number of WMP funds have entered the bond market and used maturity mismatches and leverage to raise yields,"" said Gao Shanwen, chief economist at Essence Securities Co. in Beijing. ""If you add the implicit guarantee to that, along with a general lack of transparency and regulation, the bond market really could be the next eye of the storm in financial markets.""Banks are piling into riskier debt despite warnings of a leverage-fueled bubble from local brokerages, at least five bond defaults this year and the weakest economic growth in a quarter century. This risks a repeat of the trust industry panic that sparked emerging-market turmoil in early 2014 and protests among holders of failed products.The shift in strategy has allowed lenders to slow the decline in WMP returns. While the one-year AAA corporate bond yield has plunged 98 basis points to 3.02 percent over the past six months, the average expected yields on these products have fallen only 62 basis points to 4.53 percent, according to data from CNBenefit, which provides consulting services to banks and insurers on investment products.Wealth products have lured funds from Chinese customers with the combination of perceived guarantees and yields that trump the deposit rate, which until last Friday was capped at a maximum 2.625 percent. While some of the cash from WMPs facilitate off-balance-sheet lending though repackaged loans, 44 percent was invested in bonds or money-market instruments at end-2014, according to the China Banking Wealth Management Registration System.This has made a slide in short-end corporate debt yields and average money-market rates to the lowest since 2010 especially brutal for WMPs. In the first half of this year, managers relied on the world-topping Shanghai stock market for returns. But as equities retreated 35 percent from a June peak, the funds headed back to bonds.Paying OutWhile some WMPs are now bringing in less than what the lenders pay out, banks are reluctant to lower returns for fear of losing clients, according to Li Linxia, a researcher at CNBenefit. Last week’s scrapping of a ceiling on deposit rates will make little difference to the reliance on WMPs because customers are still drawn to the higher yields they offer.The risk to banks will increase should there be a correction in the bond market, as was predicted by 10 economists surveyed by Bloomberg this month.Expectations of a drop come as shares head for the first monthly advance since May and a jump in repurchase transactions -- where investors use their debt holdings as collateral for funds -- fuel speculation that policy makers may step in to rein in excessive leverage. The 10-year government bond yield rose two basis points this week in the first weekly increase since August.Any sudden declines in bond prices risk margin calls on WMPs that could lead to a selloff, said Zhang Zhiming, head of China research at HSBC in Hong Kong. Private-placement notes, which are less liquid, may drop especially quickly, he added.""The perception so far is whatever WMP you buy at the bank counter won’t have any default risk, so it’s a competition based on yield,"" said Zhang. ""If the government tries to unwind the excessive leverage or allows default to happen, you may trigger redemptions. That means you have to sell down.""";Wealth Management;http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-29/china-banks-piling-on-risky-debt-test-faith-in-wealth-products
349;"Advances in technology have generated a more sophisticated approach to examine the patterns of information, simple or complex. Understanding such ""big data"" or gigantic data sets has enriched daily lives from preventing diseases to combatting crimes. Financial sectors remain no exception. Banks now better understand their clients' financial motives and interests through reviewing their consuming as well as saving habits. Traditionally, Korean banks primarily profit from differing rates in lending and borrowing. However, banks and customers will enjoy more wealth with more aggressive practices, for from small to large, they altogether share the same interests in downsizing expenditures and multiplying savings. Administering wealth management for larger segments of people and establishing a new online ""platform"", erected by banks, where ""peers"" or a group of ""clients"" conduct their financing will deliver a new source of revenue. Initiated years ago in the name of ""private banking"", banks have provided select high-net-worth individuals with ""wealth management"". After scrutinizing the clients' finance status and objectives, banks design ""portfolios"" or a detailed blueprint to more efficiently and effectively manage their assets from savings to taxes. With expertise in operating private banking, banks can further target and encourage a broader spectrum of clients to receive wealth management. Big data analysis will guide banks to handle disseminated information about clients. With clients' approval, banks can access their financial information scattered across a wide array of financial institutions and engineer preferred or best wealth management portfolios tailored to each client's taste. An increasing number of customers concerned about their financial stability will welcome custom-tailored wealth management. The benefit of the new program will outweigh its cost if carefully coordinated with the assistance of big data mining specialists. In addition to expanding wealth management to more customers, banks can revolutionize the traditional lending practice. Based on the business model of United States-based firm LendingClub, Korean banks can also attract potential investors and borrowers into a ""platform"" they build online. Only in Korea, the investors are the same ""peers"" or ""customers"" but who enjoy high levels of sizeable assets looking for returns on their lending. At more favorable interest rates, more customers will join the platform helping themselves, at the same time creating unwitnessed revenues in fees for banks. The amount of big data banks already possess will make the entire process less burdensome; the online platform transactions will produce almost no cost. Banks will have to screen investing and borrowing customers for their financial records to identify the ""eligibles"" for entering the platform. While true that only the clients sharing the same bank accounts can join the online platform in the initial period since banks should background-check each participant to ensure safe transactions, the expected cooperation among banks seeking for heightened profitability will boost cross-bank platform transactions, enlarging the platform lending market. Big data analysis has ushered in predictability in businesses. Once the realm of high-income individuals, more people can benefit from wealth management from their banks thanks to the new technique. Banks process overwhelming electronic data to identify needs of every client to best serve each client's financial goals as they secure another income source. The classic model of bank lending should also remodel itself to distributing lending power to other qualified investing customers eager to earn more. Created online at no or minimum cost, the platform where investing and borrowing customers meet to observe their transactions will pioneer a new medium of financing for both lenders and borrowers. It will also contribute to luring sleeping money in grey economy to the public. Individual Information Protection Law and Electronic Financial Transaction Law need partial revisions to ensure more members of society benefit from new wealth management and peer-to-peer lending. The new changes will revitalize the banking industry and invite added prosperity for greater members of society to celebrate.

350;The future is here: 2015 is the year of self-driving cars, virtual reality worlds and palm-sized flying drones. So let's talk about how science fiction is becoming reality, and the impact it will have on wealth management.Trend 1: Integrated Wearable ComputingJust around the corner is the ubiquitous integration of smart computing into the fabric of our everyday life. What used to be expensive and enormous, in the form of mainframes and desktops, is now compressed into the smallest shapes of hardware. These shapes will be worn on our bodies, attached to clothing and built as sensors into the environment.This trend, called wearable computing, is already in the marketplace in glasses, jewelry and watches. The devices are revolutionary in both their collection and communication of data. As passive objects integrated into our daily routines, they can measure and store our physical markers like heart rate and hours of sleep. A connected GPS can map out our path through work and leisure. Embedded video cameras will record every moment of life, and save the stream to a private, secure database.Financial institutions will have more information about prospects and clients than ever before. Devices will generate personal data on an unprecedented scale, to be saved and accessed whenever needed. Controlling such access through privacy and security will be paramount. Advisors will be able to access not just financial information, but anything a sensor can track and a client wants to share. From insurance products to service models, this data will create a picture of households that will be truly holistic.Impact for Advisors: Wealth management workflows will also be impacted. For example, we already use a tap of the thumb on a small computing device to authorize financial transactions. Similarly, a wearable sensor that authenticates through Apple Pay would be more secure than any paper process the advisory industry uses today.Trend 2: Image RecognitionNow that we have all this data, how do we make sense of it? How do we parse it and gain a true understanding of the individual underneath?The answer is machine learning. Based on a recent development in artificial intelligence called “neural networks,” computers can scan billions of images and look for faces and objects within them. Think of an image that we may want to find: a face of a friend, a dog, a mountain. For each of those images, an algorithm is trained to be the expert finder.Google Photos offers this functionality freely today along with infinite storage. The developers’ hope is that users will find it more convenient for software to organize and tag their photos than through manual intervention. And as the sheer volume of information continues to increase, machine learning will be the only way we can keep up.Impact for Advisors: Every individual who allows algorithms to categorize their images will, as a byproduct, create a full graph of expressed preferences that is true and accurate in a way that no risk questionnaire can hope to capture.An advisor can learn if their client is a cat or dog person, whether they like to travel or renovate their home, how many children they have and what age they are. Software can impute risk tolerance and capacity for risk taking. It can prompt the opening of a 529 plan after noticing a photograph of a newborn baby.Trend 3: Natural Language ProcessingIn addition to the preferences generated with images, we already have the ability to create personality profiles based on what people say to each other on the Internet. A computer can analyze all of the written and spoken communication from a particular person, and then translate the words and sentences into moods and meanings. Over the longer term, a picture emerges about the personality of the writer, her biases and individual quirks.One example is Five Labs, which uses semantic analysis and natural language processing to understand what written language implies about the author. Another provider is IBM Watson, a supercomputer with machine learning capabilities.Impact for Advisors: Watson unearths an even deeper behavioral profile, called Personality Insights, and is working with wealth managers today. It can uncover whether your clients are introverted or extroverted, inventive or conservative, and value achieving a larger purpose or a life of comfort. All this before a single meeting takes place.Amazingly, many of the tools and technologies to run such a complex analysis are already open source, meaning they are available for anyone to grow and modify. The input text, whether on Facebook, Twitter or other social media, can be analyzed into sentences and intended meanings, and then can be associated with broader topics, moods and personal attributes. This technology makes paper risk profile questionnaires woefully antiquated.Trend 4: Digitization of Cash and SecuritiesOnce we know our clients better than ever, let's explore innovations in the technology of the investing product itself. There are numerous innovations happening within asset classes, particularly in improved algorithms for matching lenders and borrowers. But the most fundamental innovation of the decade is, without question, digital currency and its infrastructure.Bitcoin is famous for its volatility, which unfortunately distracts from the actual vision — the unique technological infrastructure that enables a bookkeeping system without the need for a centralized authority. Traditionally, the supply of cash and other financial instruments (like stocks and bonds) is determined by a government or individual private institutions. Digital currencies, however, use a completely different system called the block chain, composed of a public ledger of all transactions, shared between every participant in the system. Each individual user may not be particularly trustworthy, but taken together, with each participant algorithmically checking the accounting of everyone else, the outcome is highly secure and reliable.Impact for Advisors: This infrastructure can be used for much more than digital cash. It can drive trusted and secure authentication, contracting, financial data and private transactions. Large banks (Goldman Sachs, Barclays) and credit card companies (Citi, Visa) are now backing the innovative technology by investing in digital wallet companies, and forming consortiums to back innovation.What if the U.S. dollar itself became fully digital and the Federal Reserve adopted and approved a block-chain-type ledger for the expansion of a digital USD? Digital dollars matter because they can be divided into tiny fractions that allow for micro-transactions. This would usher in a new age of online commerce: Imagine 5 million underbanked clients being able to pay their financial advisors 0.25% on $150.00.Similarly, a digital version of a stock or ETF could be divisible into infinitely small fractions. As a result, a newborn with a 529 plan would have an institutional-quality global asset allocation model with just $0.25 in her account. Account minimums become irrelevant in an age where tech-enabled advisors select the appropriate asset allocation, and digital asset management products can implement it.Trend 5: Crowd-Sourced Asset ClassesWho is wiser, the expert or the crowd?Traditionally, the wealth management industry comprises experts with superior information and education identifying the “right” ways to invest. Those approaches have included everything from Modern Portfolio Theory to day trading and quantitative hedge funds. But what if the crowd is indeed wiser?Impact for Advisors: From a retail distribution point of view, crowdsourced investment products have struggled. Interactive Brokers recently bought Covestor, and Wealthfront famously pivoted to a passive investing model. However, from an asset management perspective, there is a new generation of meaningful and interesting new financial products that could be part of an allocation selected by an investment advisor.With Quantopian, a crowdsourced hedge fund with a browser-based algorithmic trading platform, developers can write code and share investment strategies as a community. Motif Investing has over 130,000 motifs created and customized by its users. AngelList Syndicates, a platform to invest in early stage private companies, which traditionally requires understanding detailed legal and business information, allows investor to follow a trustworthy investor “lead” with as little as a $1,000 investment.These online algorithms compete with the beta-only robo-advisors and serve investors of all investment personalities, from Vanguard Bogleheads to returns-chasing day traders. Such investment technology will inevitably become widely available. Already, there are open source robo-advisor code repositories and Black-Litterman portfolio optimization white papers. All that remains is to create a distributed community where the best algorithm is matched with the client's financial situation and personality in a secure environment. Accounts open, data flows and fees are paid digitally and automatically.What Should You Be Doing?These trends are a fundamental transformation of our industry. The current focus on digital advice providers — the robo-advisors — is merely a precursor to much larger developments.So what is the role of a financial advisor in a future accelerated by technology?;Wealth Management;http://www.thinkadvisor.com/2015/11/02/5-sci-fi-trends-in-wealth-management?page=3
351;When Jeff Thibault learned that his client’s wife had received a diagnosis of stage IV melanoma—a form of skin cancer that has metastasized and is difficult to treat—he introduced the family to PinnacleCare, a Baltimore-based private health advisory service.“The client was trying to find research, and they were doing a lot of it themselves,” says Thibault, a wealth advisor with Morgan Stanley Private Wealth Management in Houston. PinnacleCare not only worked with the family to find a facility doing the very latest research on the treatment of stage IV melanoma, the company also helped organize the day-to-day business of medical records, doctor visits, insurance coverage and the like. “It relieved a huge burden,” Thibault says. PinnacleCare, along with other companies such as Los Angeles-based Private Health Management, is part of a growing trend in private health advisory services that can be helpful for financial advisors. Americans are living longer, even if those added years aren’t necessarily healthy ones, and people of means are willing to pay for help navigating a complex and expensive health-care system, especially when a catastrophic illness strikes and quick access to the best possible care becomes a priority.“Financial advisors will often ask, why should we care? That’s health management not wealth management, and we do wealth management,” says Deanna Rodriguez, PinnacleCare’s executive vice president of sales. “And the answer is, whether it’s wealth management or not, the financial advisor is very often the one who gets the phone call.”PinnacleCare specializes in locating—and getting expedited referrals to—top specialists and groundbreaking treatments. But it also offers around-the-clock medical advice and support anywhere in the world the client goes, medical records management and digitization, and the arrangement of in-home and elder-care services. And while we may think of ultra-high-net-worth folks with family offices as the typical target for exclusive care, PinnacleCare also has relationships with large brokerages and wealth management firms. Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, UBS and Ayco (a comprehensive financial planning firm owned by Goldman Sachs), offer PinnacleCare’s services to their wealth management clients. All but Merrill Lynch also offer plans to their own employees. PinnacleCare now has more than 3,000 clients with full annual memberships, which range in cost from roughly $10,000 to $30,000 depending on the level of care needed. The company also offers its brokerage clients à la carte services that run $5,000 a year or less. While PinnacleCare’s annual memberships are costly, the company argues that it can actually save money in some cases by avoiding unnecessary procedures or ineffective treatments. In looking at 1,000 cases over a three-year period, it found 34% resulted in a change in diagnosis, treatment or course of care, and 2% avoided unnecessary surgery as a result of a PinnacleCare intervention. Even if your clients don’t choose private health advisory services, there’s a decent chance those nearing retirement will come to you at some point with health-care-related questions, whether it’s concerning Medicare enrollment or the cost of care for an aging parent. A recent survey from PNC Financial Services found that 78% of respondents with more than $1 million in assets worried that health care would be expensive in retirement. The survey also found that more than a third of millionaires were worried about drug costs, 75% were concerned about out-of-pocket costs and half were fretful about insurance premiums.;Wealth Management;http://www.fa-mag.com/news/integrating-health-into-wealth-management-23684.html
352;Betterment, a seven-year old “robo-adviser” wealth manager, surpassed rival Wealthfront this week after surpassing $3 billion in assets under management — nearly tripling client funds since January, CEO Jon Stein told The Post.The milestone comes seven months after an online spat erupted among Betterment, Wealthfront, and Charles Schwab, which had started its own automatic investing platform.At that time, each company was amping up its marketing battle plan and publicly dissed their rivals’ fee structure in an attempt to woo new customers.“When Schwab entered the space there were a lot in the industry saying, ‘Oh this is going to be trouble for Betterment,” Stein said. “In fact, what we saw was that we started growing faster.”Schwab, which has almost $2.5 trillion in total assets, has more than $4 billion invested in its robo-platform, spokeswoman Alison Wertheim told The Post.Robo-advisers are online-centered investing platforms that rely on automatic investing strategies rather than flesh-and-blood wealth managers.While Betterment has a tiny amount of assets under management compared to traditional wealth managers, it recently has gotten approval from Goldman Sachs so that its employees can use the platform alongside Fidelity for investing.Betterment also is in talks with JPMorgan Chase for the same approval, Stein said.Kate Wauck, a Wealthfront spokeswoman, declined to provide a precise figure of the company’s assets, and instead referred to the Web site that boasts of “nearly $3 billion of [clients’] assets.”;Wealth Management;http://nypost.com/2015/11/04/fast-growing-robo-advisor-betterment-tops-3b-in-assets/
353;"The growth of automated investment advice platforms — also known as robo-advisors — is a top theme of just about every conference in the advisory industry these days. What's more, pundits are debating whether it's the next big thing in investing.And why not? The websites offer increasingly sophisticated tools to build and manage a diversified investment portfolio, they're easy to use, and they cost about a third, or even a quarter, of what a typical human advisor charges. They look like the kind of disruptive technology that could undermine the traditional relationship between investors and financial advisors. Robot and human robo advisors   Javier Pierini | Getty ImagesBy the sheer numbers, however, the dozens of venture capital-backed firms now offering software-driven advice are a non-event, according to advisory industry observers. Collectively, the robo-advisors managed less than $20 billion in assets at the end of last year, according to consulting firm Corporate Insight. As a point of reference, total U.S. retirement assets reached $24 trillion as of June 30.That's just a sliver of the financial wealth managed by investment advisors in the U.S. The surprise is not how fast these platforms have gathered assets in the last five years, but rather that they haven't had more success. Stock market graph on smartphone Buzz about robo-advisors is accelerating:  Study ""When you model disruption in an industry, this isn't what it looks like,"" said Michael Kitces, a certified financial planner and partner with Pinnacle Advisory Group. Kitces was an earlier skeptic of the notion that robo-advisors were a competitive threat to human advisors. ""At the end of the day, a balanced mutual fund of low-cost exchange-traded funds is not a very disruptive technology."" Kitces believes the market for robo-advice is not investors currently working with a human advisor, but rather those who are handling their investment management on their own. That's one good reason that Schwab and Vanguard, the two biggest firms serving do-it-yourself investors, have launched their own automated advice platforms. Robo-advisors vs. the human touch Lluís Real | Age Fotostock | Getty Images / Jose Luis Pelaez | Iconica | Getty Images Thanks to their nationally known brands, Schwab's Intelligent Portfolios and Vanguard's Personal Advisor Services are quickly surpassing market leaders such as Wealthfront — the first robo-advisor to top $1 billion in assets last year — Betterment and FutureAdvisor. As cool as the robo-offerings are, the technology won't make them successful in the market, observers say. ""The issue is not about automated investment management,"" Kitces said. ""It's about how you get a million people to trust you with their money. The only way the robo-advisors will work is if they solve the marketing issue.""To that point, 42 percent of financial planners polled in a recent industry study said they do not plan to utilize robo-advisor technology in their financial-planning offering to clients. The study, ""Financial Planning in 2015: Today's Demands, Tomorrow's Challenges,"" was conducted by the Financial Planning Association and polled 771 financial professionals.Millennials with technology Millennials and robo-advisors: A perfect  match? When asked how robo-advisor technology will be integrated, respondents discussed using it as a supplement to the advice they provide, outsourcing investment management to technology to focus on the value-add side of the business, creating a segmented service offering and targeting younger or cost-conscious clients. ""Financial planning is a process that involves much more than a simplified approach in allocating one's investment portfolio,"" said Edward Gjertsen, a CFP and FPA president. ""With that said, it stands to reason that some practices may be considering robo-technology to augment current offerings, especially for younger clients and those with simple financial situations."" Meanwhile, several financial services firms have indeed shifted gears and are making their platforms available to financial advisors to offer clients through the custodians. Fidelity Institutional, for example, has partnered with Betterment and LearnVest to make those services available to clients of the thousands of advisors who use Fidelity as their custodian. Pershing Advisor Solutions partnered with Motif Investing earlier this year. ""Technology has enabled a totally different experience for the next generation of investors, who are justifiably more cynical about the value of financial advice."" -Ron Carson, founder and CEO of Carson Wealth Management GroupWith more than 200 robo-advisors now in the market — most with no assets and little funding — a shake-out is coming, suggested Steve Lockshin, founder of Convergent Wealth Advisors. ""Some of the robo-advisors will be acquired, and some will go public, but most of them will go away within the next five years,"" said Lockshin, who was an early investor in Betterment and helped broker its deal with Fidelity. Lockshin doesn't discount the power of technology or the ultimate effect that automated investment management software will have in the industry. The robo-advisors have raised the bar as far as the digital tools that consumers will demand from their advisors in the future. ""Computers are far better at executing the Nobel Prize-winning strategy of investment diversification and rebalancing than people are, and they're much better at tax-loss harvesting, too,"" Lockshin said. ""If an advisor is just doing asset allocation and fund selection, their business will probably disappear a few years from now."" Ron Carson, a CFP and founder and CEO of Carson Wealth Management Group, thinks the robo-advisors present a fundamental challenge to the value proposition of financial advisors. If an investor can get a globally diversified investment portfolio that automatically rebalances, and get access to a lot of cool digital tools for 25 basis points, why would they pay 1 percent or more for a human advisor? Data The future looks bright for fee-based  advisors ""A good dose of paranoia is healthy,"" said Carson, who also runs an advisor coaching firm Peak Advisor Alliance. ""This market is changing.""Carson added: ""Technology has enabled a totally different experience for the next generation of investors, who are justifiably more cynical about the value of financial advice."" Carson has been spending millions to upgrade his firm's technology to give clients the ability to slice and dice data and test different investing scenarios. He's also planning to overhaul the way his firm interacts with clients and charges them for services. ""We want to give clients the ability to pick and choose components of the services we offer,"" he explained. That could mean using robo-like tools in some cases and giving access to a human advisor when the client wants. ""We're trying to figure it out."" ";Wealth Management;http://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/19/
354;Automated portfolio investing services, more commonly known as robo-advisors, are all the rage these days. They appeal to investors who are uncertain about the markets, or who don’t have the time or interest to keep a constant watch over their investments. A newly launched advisor, New York–based Huygens Capital, offers what it calls the “next generation” of automated investing. The original crop of services set up fairly static portfolios with exposure to multiple asset classes, occasionally rebalancing to keep the allocation percentages consistent over time. Although he acknowledges that these systems can be reasonably effective, Huygens CEO Walt Vester says, “The issue is that no asset class performs well in all market regimes, so at any time the portfolio has some component with a poor risk/return trade-off.” What Vester proposes instead is narrowing the set of asset classes and using a risk-prediction system to actively move the assets when certain technical indicators are met.

The expansion of these low-minimum, low-cost, high-transparency advice services goes hand in hand with growing interest in passive investing, explains Tom O’Shea, associate director at Cerulli, as reported on ETF.com.At the head of the pack in the U.S. robo-advice market are Wealthfront, Betterment and Vanguard’s Personal Advisor, notes the publication, while the European market is split up among several firms.The majority, if not all, of the retail-direct firms will have some sort of automated platform offering within the next three years, O’Shea anticipates. ETF.com points out that many registered investment advisors already offer a lower-cost digital platform to customers.But offering low-cost passive-investment vehicles will not be enough to attract investors, cautions Cerulli: robo-advisors will still have to exhibit a bit of a personal touch and human interaction.;Wealth Management;https://www.financialadvisoriq.com/c/1232803/136873
356;"FundsIndia, Arthayantra, ScripBox, MyUniverse from the Aditya Birla Money stable, BigDecisions and mainstream brokerage houses such as ICICI Securities too offer robo advisory services. Two more robo advisory platforms are tipped to be launched soon. Select asset management companies too have initiated a facility whereby an investor is recommended schemes best suited to meet his goals based on the age and the risk appetite. The saving amount needed each month to achieve the goal too is suggested. In India, the entire basket of mutual funds is assessed and the recommended funds are based on your risk appetite, age, goals and your investment horizon. In contrast, robo advisors in the US and the UK throw up options of investing in exchange traded funds or index funds, which mirror the index (Nasdaq etc), and hence are low-cost investment options compared to actively managed funds.""New set of investors cannot do things entirely by themselves. As an investor you need to know which funds to choose, what sort of debt-equity mix to have. Else you would have to visit the advisor's office and discuss. The built portfolios are highly amiable when you are investing to meet specific goals in mind. They suggest any increase or decrease in the investment amount to meet the goals,"" says Vidya Bala, head- MF research at FundsIndia.No frills advice and customisation are sought by investors. Abhishake Mathur, head investment advisory services, ICICI Securities, says, ""Our internal research shows that customers prefer advice that is specific to their situation and which they can access regularly, on-the-go and at their convenience.""Benefits Low-cost is one of the magnet pulling fresh investors to opt for the robo-advisory services in India. These automated portfolios are either offered free of cost or at a nominal cost, for instance Rs 1,000 by Arthayantra, compared to Rs 15,000 to Rs 35,000 that a traditional brick and mortar advisor would charge.There is zero-paperwork involved, says Bala.""The investing and withdrawal process for investors is also completely online and investors do not need to talk to anyone. Scripbox is so easy to use that we rarely get any questions once accounts have been set up,"" says Sanjiv Singhal, co-founder & CEO of Scripbox.Fund selection Asked about the parameters for funds selection, Singhal says, ""Our methodology looks at consistency of performance rather than absolute performance over a reasonably long period and we use multiple variables. We start by defining investment objectives for each portfolio: market growth for equity funds and safety of capital for debt funds. Then we apply a set of filter criteria and finally criteria for consistency of performance. The criteria are all quantitative and there is no human judgment involved.""My Universe uses its proprietary research model termed Optimum Efficiency Model to recommend schemes.The clients Not just first-time mutual fund investors, but existing investors too have been lapping up the robo advisory service claim entrepreneurs.""More than half of our customers are first time investors - not young earners, but people in their thirties. The sophisticated investors understand and appreciate the value of an automated investing account with a scientific and unbiased selection process, one-click investing, annual reviews and tax-efficient rebalancing. They understand how complex some of these tasks can become once you have been investing for a few years,"" says Singhal.Customisation If you are looking to invest in funds that your friend suggested or what you read from your trusted expert in the newspaper you would be disappointed if you opted for the robo-advisory service. There are limitations to the customisation possible.Once you key in your answers that test your risk appetite and the investment timeframe, then you would have limited options to select a scheme. You would have to follow the recommended investment in the same proportion, else opt for an upgraded advisory facility. Alternatively, you can head to the asset management company's website and invest directly. But one cannot change the funds. ZipSip allows you to invest in a single fund or even make lumpsum investments.""If you are confident of your choice of funds (not basing it on a tip) then invest directly with the mutual fund company,"" recommends Singhal, adding that for those looking at individual schemes several options are available in the market.But other service providers say they don't stop at offering pure robo advisory alone. ""If the investor feels the need for additional help or a customised portfolio he/she has the option of talking to our advisors. They will check the portfolio and suggest the changes if needed. Nobody can do away with the human element to advisory. But robo advisory is similar to banking online, which is as efficient and time saving,"" says Bala.Even ICICI Securities offers customisation based on the goals and time horizon. ""We spend considerable time with our clients to understand their situation and prepare a customized financial plan,"" adds Mathur.Out-of-the-box approach The innovative approach to the process of investing would set the robo advisors apart. There are various value additions that they offer, thanks to the adoption of technology.You can escape the delay (typically a month's cycle) in setting up an SIP through MyUniverse's instant SIP facility, wherein the first SIP transaction is diverted through the net banking account instead of the traditional cheque-mode and the ECS for the following months is set up before the next transaction date.Though FundsIndia has been offering robo advisory for more than four years now, the yearly reviews and portfolio re-balancing options have been added in June 2013.""So, if your ideal asset mix should be 70:30, but the share of equity has fallen significantly because of the performance of a particular asset class, then re-balancing on your own would be a cumbersome task. You would also need to know the current asset mix to be able to re-balance. That's where technology plays an important role and algorithmically the system would recommend the changes required,"" explains Bala.ICICI Securities's Track & Act monitors deviations in the customer's target asset allocation, target savings and target portfolio. The platform will automatically prompt for any action required based on the customer's financial plan.For those looking to switch funds or redeem, the Scripbox service warns the investor about the tax implications.";Wealth Management;http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-seek-a-robo-advisor-if-you-don-t-have-time-to-manage-investments-2134197

358;"According to two anonymous sources cited by Bloomberg, Bank of America’s Merrill Edge has put dozens of employees to work on a robo advisor prototype that will service accounts with less than $250,000. Bank of America plans to unveil the service next year. While few details were given, the news should hardly come as a surprise to those following the industry. Automated investment services from both independent startups and traditional financial services firms continue their rapid growth, and executives with Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley have both indicated an interest in developing or acquiring a robo advisor. “We’re actively looking at any and all potential options to continue to make sure we’re at the forefront of the industry,"" said Aron Levin, the head of Merrill Edge, in June. ""The question is at what point do you decide to evolve that and explore that.” Turns out millennials (born between 1980 and 1995) are highly successful entrepreneurs. According to a recent survey of almost 2,600 multimillionaire entrepreneurs in 18 countries released by BNP Paribas, millennial-run businesses outperform those led by baby boomers by 43 percent, although that varies greatly by region. In Asia, millennial entrepreneurs posted annual revenues 6 percent higher than baby boomer-led businesses. In the U.S. millennials outperform boomers by 318 percent. And millennials tend to start younger. The average age of a millennial business entrepreneur is 27.7 years, compared to 35.3 years for baby boomers. Passive management is not, in fact, passive—not entirely. At least that’s the argument of Jason Voss, content director for the CFA Institute, in a recent blog post. Voss says that in every index and exchange traded fund, “human choice is involved.” Take the S&P 500 Index, for instance. The index, Voss writes, is maintained by the U.S. Index Committee, which meets monthly and reviews pending corporate actions, statistics, companies being considered for the index, and significant market events. “‘The Index Committee may revise index policy covering rules for selecting companies, treatment of dividends, share counts or other matters.’ To me this sounds very similar to a description of the activities of an investment committee at an actively managed mutual fund,” Voss said. It’s been a tough couple of months for the public perception of Christy Walton. First, she was dethroned as America’s richest woman by her sister-in-law Alice; now it turns out that she never actually held that lofty title in the first place. Since Wal-Mart heir John T. Walton's death in a plane crash 10 years ago, it’s been widely assumed that his wife, Christy, was the beneficiary of most of his estate. However, Bloomberg News managed to get the Wyoming court filings unsealed, and our assumptions about John’s estate turned out to be mistaken. According to the documents, he left half of his $17 billion fortune to a charitable trust and a third to only child Lukas. Christy got the rest. So, her fortune sits at a mere $5 billion, not the $32 billion it was thought to be. Hardly even worth mentioning anymore, really.";Wealth Management;http://wealthmanagement.com/blog/merrill-edge-reportedly-developing-robo
359;Brokerages have been angling to prepare for a multitrillion-dollar shift of wealth from one generation to the next, in part by trying to make themselves more attractive to millennials. But new research shows that Generation X, those who are between the ages of 35 and 50 this year, will be the main holders of wealth for decades before the millennials get their turn.The report being released Tuesday by the Deloitte Center for Financial Services, a unit of Deloitte Consulting LLP, says Generation X “will become the next big fee pool for financial services firms.”The baby boomers, those who are between 51 and 69 this year, are currently the wealthiest group and they will retain that spot until at least 2030, according to the report. Boomers hold about 50% of the total wealth in the U.S. now and they are expected to peak at 50.2% by 2020. Deloitte says that by 2030, that will decline to 44.5%,  and it will taper off even further in subsequent years “as mortality rates escalate.”Generation Xers will grow their share of net household wealth from 14% currently to nearly 31% by 2030, the report says. Millennials, those who are between 18 and 34 this year, will represent less than 20% of total U.S. wealth throughout that time.Deloitte’s wealth projections are all through the year 2030. But the combination of increasing mortality rates for boomers and the Generation Xers entering their prime earning years will position them to “overtake baby boomers as America’s wealthy generation soon thereafter,” Deloitte says.As for the miillennials, Deloitte says their wealth will remain far below boomers’ and Generation X for the foreseeable future.The total amount of wealth in the U.S. is expected to grow from $72 trillion today to $120 trillion by 2030.“The wealth-management business is going to be huge,” says  Val Srinivas, the report’s author and a research leader in banking and securities for Deloitte. “There’s a lot of wealth that’s going to be created over the next few years, but who is going to hold this wealth? Generation Xers will see the highest increase in wealth.”Securities firms have been trying to get ahead of this shift in wealth by building out digital education programs aimed at helping put advisers in touch with their clients’ children. UBS Group AG and  Morgan Stanley  have each rolled out such programs this year.The program launched by UBS, for example, includes four age-specific courses, from elementary-school-aged children to adults, covering personal-finance topics like saving and investing and how credit scores work.While these digital offerings appear to be more tailored to increase interactions with the millennial generation,  Gauthier Vincent, a principal at Deloitte Consulting LLP, says a similar approach can also work for Generation X.“As firms build an offering that’s going to try to capture millennials, you also end up serving a lot of Generation X clients who are digital savvy,” Mr. Vincent says. “So you are going to appeal to a broad range of clients beyond [Generation X].”;Wealth Management;http://www.wsj.com/articles/in-trying-to-attract-millennials-dont-forget-gen-x-and-its-money-1447106400

361;"The exchange-traded funds industry will see its third bank player emerge, as TD Asset Management is set to launch its own suite of ETFs in early 2016.“In early part of next year, we'll be rolling out our proprietary suite of ETFs, both passive and active in nature,” Leo Salom, executive vice-president of TD Wealth Management, said during the TD Retail Investor Day last month. Details of the new ETF offering have not been released by TD, but Mr. Salom discussed the offering as part of TD Wealth Management’s initiatives to launch a number of lower-cost alternatives to longer-term investors.“[Clients] are looking for lower-cost solutions,” Mr. Salom said. “They want to avoid paying full-service brokerage fees, but yet they're willing to pay for asset allocation and investment guidance.”The announcement came just prior to TD Asset Management adding 33 mutual funds to its D-series funds, which offer self-directed investors access to actively managed, lower-cost mutual funds. TD also has had success with its TD E-series funds, which compete with ETFs and are popular with index investors.“We listened to our clients and their advisers, and are continually evolving our solutions to meet their needs,” Tim Wiggan, chief executive officer of TD Asset Management Inc., said in a statement to The Globe and Mail about TD entering the ETF market. Details of the new ETFs will be announced before launch.As of September, 2015, Canadian-listed ETF assets were $86.5-billion, according to National Bank Financial.Both Bank of Montreal and Royal Bank of Canada are already operating in the ETF space, with BMO being the second-largest player in market share with $23.7-billion in ETF assets.“There’s been strong growth in the Canadian ETF space in recent years, so it’s no surprise that we’re seeing new providers emerge,” says Kevin Gopaul, senior vice-president and chief investment officer at BMO Global Asset Management.“Ultimately, [a new player] means more choice for investors and will encourage product innovation and stronger offerings.”This isn’t the first time TD has entered the ETF marketplace. It first launched ETFs back in 2001 with four Canadian equity ETFs. But despite beating its competitors to market, the company exited the business in 2006 due to low trading volumes.TD’s re-entrance into the market has been widely anticipated within the industry.“A potential new ETF player like TD Bank does not come as a surprise as we believe that most banks and mutual fund companies in Canada with distribution have some interest in ETFs, particularly the strategic beta and actively managed spaces,” said Steve Hawkins, co-CEO of Horizons ETFs Management (Canada) Inc. “Becoming an ETF issuer will not be for everyone, but the ETF industry is rapidly maturing in Canada, so it cannot be ignored. As a result, we would expect to see new ETF entrants in Canada, especially those with strong distribution channels.”There are currently 12 ETF players in the Canadian market with Lysander Funds, a retail affiliate of Canso Investment Counsel, entering just last month. At the same time, industry giant CI Financial Corp. purchased ETF provider First Asset Capital Corp., adding 42 actively managed and factor-based ETFs to its platform.“Distribution is to financial services what location is to real estate. And while ETFs are distributed in many of the same channels as mutual funds; an ETF product lineup will grab a slice of the investor pie that firms like CI and TD don’t have today,” said Dan Hallett, vice-president and principal with HighView Financial Group. “It makes sense for them to enter the ETF space from a business perspective since there is likely a good amount of growth ahead for ETFs, thanks in part to pending regulatory changes.”";Wealth Management;http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/funds-and-etfs/etfs/td-becomes-latest-bank-player-to-offer-etfs/article27083476/

363;"The digital advice market, or robo advice, is projected to become an even bigger industry, with $489 billion assets under management by 2020, according to new research, and will become a more important part of an advisor’s investment proposition. The latest report from Boston-based Cerulli Associates said that large, retail direct firms are driving this growth and have captured “considerable market share.” Services such as Wealthfront, Betterment and Vanguard’s Personal Advisor are leading the online advice trend in the U.S., while companies like Nutmeg and Swanest in the UK, vaamo in Germany, TrueWealth in Switzerland, MoneyFarm in Italy and Marie Quantier in France are introducing variations of low-cost and robo advice to Europe. Large Retail Firms Joining InTom O’Shea, associate director at Cerulli, said robo advisors offer low-minimum and low-cost portfolios, and it coincides with expanding interest in passive investing. “In addition, we anticipate that most, if not all, retail direct firms will have a digital advice offering within the next three years, and traditional advisors will also launch digital offerings for lower-balance investor accounts,"" he said. There are many examples of registered investment advisors in the U.S. who are already offering digital services to lower-cost clients, as ETF.com reporter Cinthia Murphy found, proving robo advisors and traditional wealth planners are not such strange bedfellows as was once thought. Passive Investment Gives BoostCerulli forecasts that the growth of robo advice will be boosted by the growth of passive investing. Silvan Schumacher, co-founder of UK-based robo advisor Swanest, wrote in a blog for ETF.com: “They [ETFs] offer a very smart investment strategy at a low cost, are extremely transparent and provide access to a universe of opportunities.” Cerulli also warned that robo advice still needs to have an element of personal touch and human interaction. One example of this is wealth manager Nutmeg moving to offer financial advice. Drago Indjic, portfolio manager at robo advisor ETFmatic, wrote in an ETF.com blog in October that ETFs can help lower costs—clients can buy in for as little as £50 per month [$75]—but still receive a personal service. “At ETFmatic we allow our clients to define highly granular investment strategies for each goal, including asset allocation, ongoing rebalancing and trade execution,” he said.";Wealth Management;http://www.etf.com/sections/features-and-news/robo-assets-489b-2020
364;Robo advice platforms in the UK are not replacing traditional financial advisers yet, according to Nick Hungerford, CEO of Nutmeg. His comments come less than a month after he was named as one of the FCA’s expert panel for the Financial Advice Market Review, which has put robo-advice firmly on the menu of options being considered to plug the advice gap.In the cover story of Money Management’s November issue, Mr Hungerford said online companies in the UK were so far only doing the investment management. “We are not yet doing the advice side. Obviously we have applied for a licence at Nutmeg but that hasn’t yet been granted so it will help when that happens,” he added. Mr Hungerford claims that, once granted permission, Nutmeg should be the first to offer online advice in the UK. The advice will involve helping clients with day-to-day investment decisions and thus Nutmeg has been hiring advisers to join the team. These advisers will be like research agents and will also be available to meet customers if they wish. The robo-advice market is becoming more popular day by day. Money Management’s feature states the total global assets administered by robo-adviser will grow to £168bn by the year 2020, according to financial research firm MyPrivateBanking. This is still a very small figure when compared with the assets managed by traditional financial advisers, which totalled £40.7tn, as of March 2015.The market is more established in the US. As of December 2014, robo-advisers there managed about $19bn (£12bn), according to Corporate Insight, a financial services research firm. This represented a 21 per cent increase in assets under management since July that year, and a 65 per cent increase since April. So how do these platforms work? On a very basic level, a robo-advice platform works very similarly to the way a traditional financial adviser works. “The questions we ask are exactly the same questions a traditional private bank or a wealth manager would ask,” says Nick Hungerford, CEO of Nutmeg. “There is absolutely no difference. The difference is that we ask them online versus on a face-to-face basis and I think that is really important because it is statistically true that most people are less likely to be scared or give answers that they think people want to hear when they are online.”One of the biggest obstacles to robo-advice becoming established in the UK is because the word “advice” has a very specific meaning. While robo-advice can provide general recommendations, it still does not provide tailored financial advice like a traditional financial adviser. It is important for the government and other stakeholders to come up with a definition that makes sense for customers, says Mr Hungerford. “Sounds simple, but if we could do that we would be making a huge start on the way to solving the advice gap and allowing people to get good advice,” he adds.;Wealth Management;http://www.ftadviser.com/2015/11/04/investments/nutmeg-ceo-robo-advice-won-t-replace-traditional-advisers-hVKHk4o8uVP6WecsZtpCQL/article.html
365;"Every dollar is the same. And the dollar value of all your assets combined is your total portfolio. But to someone who manages a superannuation fund, a member's savings balance is that person's whole world of assets in one. It is not a great assumption to make.Two members of the same super fund could have wildly different balance sheets. One could own a property freehold, the other could have a huge portfolio outside super stacked high with small companies listed on the ASX.If they are both in a balanced super fund the first member will be better off in a higher growth option (because her personal portfolio is already loaded up with lower-risk property), and the second member will be better off in a more conservative fund (because his direct stock portfolio is definitely high risk).  Chances are they both ended up in the fund by default and haven't thought about whether it's appropriate for years, if ever. The super fund isn't too worried about the arrangement because it has enough work on its hands investing 9.5 per cent of the gross pay of thousands upon thousands of members.Likewise, someone who follows a stock tip will be completely oblivious to the fact that his super fund may have gone similarly overweight on the same company months earlier.It turns out every saver, every worker, is expected to be custodian of their own affairs but the tools they need to help them stick to a strategy are out of reach. And nothing is made any clearer by the fact Australian fund managers do not have to disclose their holdings.     It makes it very hard to know if the total investment mix is right and where to invest without doubling up or wandering off course.Automated risk-profile advice neededWhat everyone needs is a place where they can plonk in the details about every single financial asset they own – super, savings, investments – then push a button to find out where they are off-balance against their risk profile.That is the real frontier for automated advice, or ""robo advice"".   It isn't any good to be given a recommended portfolio for a fresh lump of capital, because those very same investments may already be in the user's super account or personal portfolio.It would be a complete fluke if that sort of robo adviser spat out an optimum mix of investments to complement a user's holdings in super and outside super. It is impossible.An automated advice service which takes existing assets into account and then recommends optimum portfolio allocations to match the user's risk profile is the solution. If the banks aren't already working on such a tool, they should be.  Consumers must learn it's no good to think of the investment classes as castles, standing alone from one another. It's likely they don't think that way at all. But many investment professionals do.The owners of capital need a bit more respect. They deserve a better set of tools.Every dollar is the same, and any automated investment tool worth anything to anyone would start right there. Only by taking into account all their assets can savers, consumers, anyone who owns anything outside super know if they are being true to their objectives when having to decide how to invest the next free dollar they get.";Wealth Management;http://www.afr.com/personal-finance/lock-stock-and-barrel-the-only-robo-advice-that-counts-20151109-gkuxay

367;"PIEtech Inc., the creators of MoneyGuidePro, on Thursday announced the release of myMoneyGuide, the industry's first technology solution capable of delivering scalable, quality financial planning guidance. The product combines a new, modern technology that helps advisors, firms and employers offer financial plans on an unprecedented scale. The new product guides investors through the online creation of their own financial plan in a safe, objective and unbiased environment via a private invitation only available from an advisor, firm, employer or association, according to PIEtech. Upon completion of the myMoneyGuide Lab, investors can request professional advice from the advisor or firm who invited them. All labs are delivered by certified financial planners  employed by myMoneyGuide.""We've never seem as much excitement around a product release as we have with myMoneyGuide,” said Bob Curtis, founder and CEO of PIEtech.Here's how it works for independent advisors: Individuals are invited to participate in a session by an advisor, either in person or digitally. In either case, they receive a link that takes them to a myMoneyGuide landing page customized with the advisors branding, picture and contact info. On the page, the invitee can select the type of session they want (small business owner, those more than 10 years from retirement, etc.), and then select a time to take the lab from the list of available sessions.They then participate in a 90-minute, guided online interactive session powered by patent-pending technology and live support. During the session, individuals build a basic financial plan in real time and ask questions of software experts who can help them input their information. After receiving an invitation, invitees may select from among hundreds of labs available at times convenient to them, including nights and weekends.Examples of offerings include labs for those approaching retirement, those already retired, small business owners and even sessions for those with a ""really good sense of humor."" Setting itself apart from existing solutions, myMoneyGuide guides attendees through the process, educates them on relevant topics, with information specific to their situation. Attendees are given a plan that they are encouraged to have reviewed, optimized and implemented by a professional financial advisor. The product offers 60 labs per week with live support, 14 hours per day. By early next year, the plan is to provide over 300 labs per day on a 24/7 basis.Once attendees have completed the lab, the system identifies areas they should discuss with an advisor, such as their specific concerns, expectations, goals, health-care costs, retirement income, Social Security strategy selection, risk tolerance, asset allocation, retirement age optimization and insurance and estate planning issues. The individual is then invited to share their information and the plan that they have created with their advisor. (In the case of a financial firm implementation, the firm would direct the individual to one of their advisors.)According to PIEtech President Kevin Knull, the invitation to share the information with an advisor is key because until the plan is reviewed and optimized by an advisor, the user cannot reap the maximum benefit from the planning process.Assuming the individual agrees to share the information with the advisor—and beta testing indicates an overwhelming majority of myMoneyGuide participants do—the data can then be fed directly into MoneyGuidePro professional financial planning software for further analysis by the advisor. Furthermore, in light of the recent integration deal between MoneyGuidePro and eMoney, advisors can leverage the power of eMoney Select to provide the client with a client portal and other features provided by the combination of MoneyGuidePro and eMoney Select.Advisors pay $75 per lab attendee; not per invitee. The payment system is similar to Google Ad words. Advisors can budget a certain amount to prospecting through myMoneyGuide, and prospects can register for labs until the budget is exhausted. For example, if an advisor budgeted $1,500 in a month to myMoneyGuide, they could invite 20 people to register for labs. “The beauty of the system is that advisors can immediately gauge their ROI”, said Curtis. “They control exactly what they want to spend, and they know how many attendees shared information and engaged with an advisor”.The product has the potential to be as impactful on the financial planning space as robo-advisors have been in the investment management space for a number of reasons:First, like robo-advisors, myMoneyGuide puts the consumer in the driver’s seat. While they must be invited by a financial intermediary or an employer to participate, once they are invited, they can  choose the type of session that they want to attend and they can choose the time. Once they get their initial results from the lab, the odds are that issues will be identified that require the help of a trained professional in order to optimally address those problems. Furthermore, lab attendees do not get indefinite access to the lab results unless they engage with an advisor. If they choose not to attend a lab, their access ends after 14 days.Second, the primary reason that individuals give for not engaging with an advisor, according to Kevin Knull, is that the initial data-gathering meeting is uncomfortable for new clients. Allowing clients to enter their own data and learn a bit about the planning process before engaging with the advisor goes a long way towards alleviating that discomfort.Third, one of the primary challenges facing advisors who provide financial planning advice is scale. Research by Technology Tools for Today (T3) indicates that up to 40% or more of the cost of producing a financial plan can be attributed to data gathering and data entry when those processes must be handled manually. In the case of myMoneyGuide, much, and in some cases all, of the data needed to complete a plan will have already been provided by the client.Fourth, many potential clients still believe that financial planning is only something available to the rich. By making it affordable for advisors to offer the labs on a large scale, and from there to produce a plan for less wealthy individuals and couples at a low cost (and they perhaps manage their assets on a very low cost, automated digital advice platform), myMoneyGuide makes acquiring a financial plan affordable to virtually everyone.";Wealth Management;http://www.fa-mag.com/news/pietech-s-mymoneyguide-financial-planning-for-the-masses-23593.html
368;"Over the next several decades, wealth managers in Canada will be battling a massive shift in wealth as billions of dollars are set to pass from boomers into the hands of the younger generation. For the investment industry, this intergenerational wealth transfer could be detrimental – as at least 75 per cent of assets under management leave a firm after an heir receives his or her inheritance, according to research by consulting firm Accenture.Investment firms will face the difficult challenge of retaining the assets of boomers, while also developing a business proposition that appeals to the next generation of tech-savvy clients.Andrew Marsh, chief executive officer of Richardson GMP, is already preparing for the next wave of investors. With $28-billion in assets under management, retaining those assets are top of mind for the 195 adviser teams at the firm.“The best advisers in the industry already have an intergenerational approach and if they don’t – they should,” says Mr. Marsh. “The problem for many wealth managers is the disconnect they have with the younger generation, who are less likely to be working with a financial adviser.”Many investors whose assets are less than $100,000 don’t hit the minimum account size to be serviced by a financial adviser working with a brokerage.To close the gap for his advisers, Mr. Marsh is building an automated platform, similar to a robo-adviser, to allow smaller accounts to be managed more efficiently. As a client’s net worth grows – and their financial planning needs increase – the client can shift onto the full-service adviser platform.“This is where automation can really help,” Mr. Marsh says. “The adviser will be able to take on their client’s family member and provide really good advice – but in a way that is fee effective and low maintenance.”While boomers tend to be more comfortable with face-to-face meetings with the adviser managing their money, members of the younger generation are turning to more technology-based options, says Sybil Verch, a portfolio manager and investment adviser at Raymond James Ltd.In keeping with the times, Ms. Verch has expanded her communication with clients and their family members to include video calls through Skype and social-media postings on Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook.“Staying in touch with the children is a key aspect of estate planning and after that initial family meeting, it is up to the adviser to customize that contact and frequency to ensure that method of communication works for everyone,” Ms. Verch says.Canada’s big banks recognize that the wealth transfer from boomers to the next generation has become a huge issue, but they believe that they’re in a good competitive position because of their large size and the wide selection of products and services they can offer to clients.The challenge, though, is to stay relevant given the fact that the transfer involves generations that tend to take a very different approach to money and retirement than previous generations, creating different strategies to wealth management.“If that’s what clients are thinking about, worried about, wondering about, we need to ensure that we are relevant in those conversations and that we are organized in a way that we can help them achieve what they are trying to achieve,” said Dave Kelly, Toronto Dominion-Bank’s senior vice-president, TD Wealth Private Wealth Management.The answer: Accept that boomers might want to transfer part of their savings to their children during their retirement years, so that they can see that money being put to use; and work with the millennial generation, which can be far more engaged with digital banking and take a more hands-on, collaborative approach to wealth management.“For previous generations, the issue was ‘How do I build a significant amount of wealth to be able to pass it along to my children and their children?’” said Glen Gowland, head of Canadian wealth management at Bank of Nova Scotia.Now, philanthropic giving is on the rise, especially among ultrahigh net worth clients, and there’s also the urge to spend money on activities that involve the next generation – driving the need for different conversations and approaches to wealth management in order to keep families as clients.The banks see themselves as well positioned here, but are aware that technology and generational shifts in views toward wealth management can bring challenges.“The world around us is changing,” said Janet Peddigrew, Bank of Montreal’s managing director of BMO private banking. “There are a lot of niche service providers, and I would say in the financial services industry we are well aware of that and we are not taking what we have for granted.”";Wealth Management;http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/retirement/wealth-industry-faces-huge-shift-as-boomers-transfer-wealth-to-their-kids/article27169919/
369;"Robo-advisors using algorithm-based systems to provide financial advice to consumers will consign 25 million jobs in the financial and legal sector to the scrap heap over the next two decades says Bank of America, in a report which paints a bleak future for the human workforce as new robot workers transform the global economy.The report says robots and other forms of artificial intelligence will take over 45% of all jobs in manufacturing and shave $9 trillion off labour costs within a decade, ushering in a new era of 'creative disruption'. Billing the coming upheavals as a fourth industrial revolution, the authors say rapid advances in technology will cause a paradigm shift in the way society lives and works. “The pace of disruptive technological innovation has gone from linear to parabolic in recent years,"" states the report. ""Penetration of robots and artificial intelligence has hit every industry sector, and has become an integral part of our daily lives.”While much of the disruption will be felt at the bottom ends of the labour market, middle class jobs are also set to feel the pinch, says Bank of America, pointing to the growing use of robo-advisors in financial planning as a prime example. The Millennial generation now 18-34 years old will be the first to switch en masse to these automated services, states the report. This rising cohort already holds $7 trillion of liquid assets and is likely to inherit another $30-$40 trillion from Baby Boom parents. A new generation of wealth management firms such as Wealthfront, Betterment, Personal Capital, and FutureAdvisor are already luring away clients from the big banks with the promise of no-frills, low cost, advisory services. Around 60% of Bay Area-based Wealthfront's customers are under 35.Many of the traditional wealth advisors are taking note, and Bank of America is no exception. The firm is understood to have put dozens of employees to work on an automated investment prototype for Merrill Edge, which targets accounts under $250,000, according to a recent Bloomberg report.

370;Please don’t call them robo-advisers.“That’s obviously a derogatory term,” says Adam Nash, president of Wealthfront.He prefers the term automated investment services. So does Betterment and SigFig, two other leading wealth management firms that use algorithms instead of humans to manage billions of dollars in individual portfolios. With software running the show, the tech startups can charge clients drastically lower fees.This sounds like a mortal threat to the nation’s 300,000 human financial advisers, an occupation that ranks high on “best jobs” lists for its good pay and work-life balance. And many analysts agree the sector is ripe for disruption, the same kind now shaking up the nation’s taxi fleets.“There’s an opportunity to do an Uber of another industry,” says Uday Singh, partner at management consulting firm A.T. Kearney.The tension of robot vs. humans is expected to play out in an increasing number of jobs in the coming years as computers get faster, the algorithms smarter. For financial advisers, the battle is already underway – just as waves of baby boomers are hitting retirement and members of the even larger millennial generation reach the point in their careers when they are thinking about setting aside funds.Billions of dollars in fees are up for grabs. The robo hype might be real. Or maybe advice dispensed by humans will triumph.  But neither side is waiting around to see how it shakes out, illustrating how the future of many industries will feature a continuing evolution, with each side trying to maximize its particular advantage.Singh believes algorithm-driven investments will be mainstream in just a few years. He co-authored a 2015 study that found consumers have rapidly turned to robo-advisers after just a couple years on the scene, with these companies projected to be managing nearly 6 percent of all U.S. investments, about $2 trillion worth, by 2020.“There is every reason to believe that adoption will be exponential,” Singh says.But mention Singh’s study to someone like Frank Moore, chief investment officer at Vintage Financial Services in Ann Arbor, Mich., and he chuckles dismissively.Replace him?“There is so much you can’t do through a computer screen,” Moore says, pointing to the counseling he did of clients during the stock market’s dark days in 2008 and 2009. “That’s not something you can program into an algorithm.”Geoffrey Brown, head of the National Association of Personal Financial Advisers, agrees.“There’s no way the robo-adviser product platform is going to take away the human interaction that comes with working with a financial adviser,” Brown says.Some dismiss robo-advisers as just target-date funds with slicker marketing -- meaning that firms such as Vanguard, which offers similar services, would have the most to lose. But that hasn’t limited the impact of robo-advisers.“They are revolutionizing everything,” says Randy Kurtz, president of financial advisory firm BetaFrontier in Chicago.Kurtz said the days of advisers just picking investments and mailing quarterly statements is over. Now, advisers need to spend time with clients, discussing goals and crafting strategies to different needs.The human adviser needs to be even more human.“The people who will survive will be more holistic,” Kurtz says. 2300-roboadviser1104 The rise of these automated services already has driven smaller portfolio-management firms to merge with firms that offer a wider range of wealth management services, says Louis Diamond, vice president at Diamond Consultants in Morristown, N.J., a search and consulting firm for financial advisers.“They are seeking out access to tailored, white-glove services,” Diamond says.Those skills are beyond computers, for now. That’s why Alex Benke, director of advice products at Betterment, thinks financial advisers will continue to have jobs. But those jobs are changing.“I think what is being disrupted is the selling of a portfolio and not doing anything else,” Benke said. “We’ve commodified the portfolio piece.”Betterment, based in New York City, manages $3 billion for 118,000 customers. There’s no minimum balance -- another development that has spread to traditional financial advisers who are hoping to capture investors earlier. At Betterment, fees range from 0.15 percent to 0.35 percent of assets. That’s significantly less than the typical adviser fee, which hovers around 1 percent.Betterment plans to start offering 401(k) services to companies in 2016. Earlier this year it launched a service for advisers that allows them to provide robo-services to their own clients.Wealthfront, based in Palo Alto, Calif., charges a 0.25 percent management fee on accounts above $10,000 and no fee below that, with a $500 minimum.Robo-advisers ask customers their age, income and questions gauging risk tolerance before selecting a series of exchange-traded funds. Many of the companies also offer tax-loss harvesting and automatic re-balancing. All decisions are made by algorithms.It’s the continuation of a long-running trend toward technological innovation and lower fees in financial services, says Nash, Wealthfront president. In 1975, Charles Schwab opened its doors as the nation’s first discount brokerage. Then Vanguard introduced index funds. More recently, exchange-traded funds became popular.Now, it’s algorithm-driven investments.Some of the larger firms have decided to imitate the newcomers. Both Schwab and Vanguard launched robo-adviser services earlier this year. And smaller advisers talk about the potential for continued downward pressure on their own fees from these new low-cost rivals.That’s not the only problem facing the industry. The profession is graying – the average adviser is 51, with fewer than 5 percent younger than 30, according to Cerulli Associates. At many industry conferences, there’s at least one session on planning for the death of a lead financial adviser.“It’s concerning,” said Brown, head of the personal financial advisers association.But with a third of advisers heading to retirement in the next decade, there’s a huge opportunity -- for someone, whether it's humans or computers.Nash says Wealthfront is “optimized for millennials.” That’s the target market. Sixty percent of its clients are under 35 years old.Betterment noted that while millennials make up the bulk of its customers, 30 percent of its business comes from clients older than 50.The question is who will capture the next wave of investors -- someone like Yazmin Chavira, whose views on investing show how messy and contested the future of financial advising will likely be.Chavira, 31, is a math teacher living in Long Island City, N.Y. She got interested in investing a couple years ago. The negligible interest rate on her bank account was not cutting it. At first, she considered opening a self-directed account to buy index funds. But she kept looking.A financial adviser would be too expensive, Chavira thought. And her situation was not complicated. She knew her parents preferred sitting down with someone to discuss finances. But she already entrusted so much of her life to computers – banking, health insurance, travel booking and shopping. She started reading about robo-advisers. She was intrigued.“Humans can make mistakes,” Chavira says. “Computers do only what we ask them to do.”She opted to open an account with Betterment.But, Chavira says, if one day she felt the need, she wouldn’t rule out visiting a human for financial advice.;Wealth Management;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2015/11/05/robo-advisers-are-here-whats-a-human-financial-planner-to-do/
371;It wasn’t too long ago that Charles Schwab & Company was inviting the investing public to “Talk to Chuck” in a series of award-winning and innovative rotoscope-animated advertisements. Boy, have times changed. Now, the company appears to have traded in their rotoscope for a robo, er, coach—and now they’re asking their clients to talk to…Hal?Well, not exactly.On Monday morning, Schwab President and CEO Walt Bettinger announced Schwab Intelligent Portfolios, a digital advice platform that the company plans on making available to its retail investors starting in early 2015. The firm also pledged to make a customizable version available to Schwab’s 7,000 Registered Investment Advisors—who collectively hold more than $1.25 trillion with the custodian—later in the year.Schwab’s announcement is a breath of fresh air from the San Francisco-based firm, who some feel has ceded large portions of their technology leadership position in recent years to scrappier competitors like Omaha-based TD Ameritrade or smaller, digital-only upstarts like Betterment and Wealthfront. It also represents a bold, inspired bet—made specifically by Bettinger—at a time when digital advice is gaining both investor and advisor mind share.“Schwab Intelligent Portfolios addresses a growing demand for affordable, objective, sophisticated and convenient advice,” Bettinger said, adding that Schwab’s new platform would “alter the investing landscape” through the combination of innovative technology and the experience, systems, and scale that Schwab has developed in over 40 years of serving individual investors.The platform will allow Schwab’s retail clients to create diversified portfolios using Schwab or third-party ETFs representing over 20 different asset classes, and also leverages new technology to provide these clients with a completely paperless experience. Registered Investment Advisors will also be able to use this platform to deliver a fully-branded digital advice experience to their own clients, although the level of customization that advisors will have in constructing their own model portfolios remains unclear—as is the platform’s advisor release date.While the timing of Schwab’s announcement is not an accident—after all, it was just last week that Fidelity disclosed a deal that will allow their RIAs to offer digital advice via Betterment’s innovative and consumer friendly platform—it’s been somewhat of an open secret among Schwab alumni that the company has been working on a digital advice strategy since late January. In fact, I’m told by a wide array of company insiders that it was Bettinger himself who spearheaded the initiative, issuing a decree earlier this year re-allocating a good portion of Schwab’s previously-committed project spend to build out this new platform (one former colleague likened the decision to Bill Gate’s famous “Internet Tidal Wave” e-mail to Microsoft from 1995).It’s unclear as to why Bettinger suddenly got the digital advice religion, but his newfound passion shifted the company’s entire 2014 strategy as swiftly and fluidly as a vial of quicksilver. Schwab Intelligent Portfolios has already sucked the air out of the sails of competing corporate initiatives, and some of the company’s best and brightest have been re-deployed against the project’s delivery. This is the clearest indication that Bettinger means business: if his lieutenants can execute on his vision, he will have given Schwab a tremendous early-mover advantage at a time when a good portion of Wall Street still seems confused with how to handle the emergence of digital advisors.While the true impact of Schwab’s foray into algorithmic advice has yet to be seen, there can be little doubt that the entrance of such a large and well-respected player—a firm representing millions of clients and over $2 trillion in investor assets—immediately legitimizes the entire category. In addition, Schwab threatens to fundamentally alter the entire environment that advisors operate in. Even with moderate adoption, Schwab Wealth Investment Advisory—the new entity that will house Schwab’s digital advisory—could become one of the largest RIAs in the nation.As I’ve previously written, digital advice represents the next big growth engine for advisors—a platform for capturing, as Bettinger himself puts it, “a broader group of investors who are less comfortable with a traditional approach to advice and prefer the power of technology to enhance and simplify their lives.” It’s a platform that will allow Schwab—and the thousands of Registered Investment Advisors who use Schwab’s custody platform—to begin servicing the next generation of investors with a simple, consumer-friendly experience while grooming them for eventual conversion to more traditional advice models as their needs become more sophisticated.;Wealth Management;http://www.etftrends.com/2014/11/talk-to-hal-schwabs-robo/
372;"Some flesh-and-blood financial advisers are competing head-on with so-called ""robos"" by providing their own low-cost automated investment advice services.David Edwards, chief executive of New York-based Heron Financial Group, is one.Since September, Edwards has spent about $40,000 and countless hours on a new, low-fee digital advice platform aimed at younger clients who want to handle their investments online.There is reason for traditional advisers to worry about competition from ""robo-advisers,"" which use algorithms to manage portfolios at a fraction of a human adviser's typical 1 percent fee. Assets managed by the automated services, which include Wealthfront Inc, Betterment and Charles Schwab Corp, will increase at least three-fold this year, to as much as $60 billion from $16 billion, according to a March report by Aite Group, a Boston-based research firm.Edwards' offering will use an algorithm from Betterment Institutional, a digital platform for advisers from Betterment LLC, to select investments and tweak portfolios. Edwards will charge clients 0.75 percent of their portfolio, instead of the 1 percent and up he charges for traditional stock and bond picking and other services. Edwards sees it as an investment in his firm's future.""The firms that don't have a digital platform for clients will be extinct in five to 10 years,"" he said.Providing an online investment management option that costs less than adviser's usual fee is a bold strategy, more so than using practice management software such as Oranj, because it segments the business. Advisers must weigh the pros and cons of doing so, said Sophie Louvel Schmitt, senior analyst at Aite Group. Those who invest in such an offering could boost their chances of reaching a younger generation. ""But before they do that, they should make sure they're not cannibalizing their business, and providing enough value to existing clients to justify the higher price,"" Schmitt said.Ritholtz Wealth Management in New York launched Liftoff, its digital-only platform, last fall. The service caters to those with at least $5,000 to invest, and they pay 0.4 percent of assets under management annually, compared with the traditional Ritholtz client, who has at least $1 million and pays 1 percent to 1.25 percent in fees per year.The firm made some tweaks during the first six months, such as adding a way to accept transfers from outside investment accounts and streamlining the process for answering clients' questions, Ritholtz Chief Executive Josh Brown said. ""It's about what we expected in terms of ongoing maintenance, which is not much at all, and that's critical to being successful,"" Brown said.Brown declined to comment on how much Liftoff manages. But he counts more than 1800 people who are either established users or are signing up.Brown, like Edwards, hopes some digital clients may eventually become traditional wealth management clients.But he is also betting that the digital platform may be used in some form by all clients, regardless of account size or fee schedule, and that makes it a worthwhile investment.""This is something that we think will pay dividends very far down the road,"" Brown said.

373;Wouldn’t it be great if you could assemble your own Frankenadvisor – part efficient, passionless robot, and part intuitive, caring human financial advisor?You might get your chance. In the few short years robo-advisors (digital advisory services) have been around, they’ve typically been positioned as the polar opposite of human advisors, who work with affluent clients. The middle of the spectrum is starting to fill in with hybrid services. That means the “mass affluent” – consumers with portfolios worth several hundred thousand dollars – have a chance to get custom advice when they need it and rely on algorithms the rest of the time, financial consultants say.Although robo-advisors, such as Betterment, present a public facade of totally automated services, their business models include introducing account holders to real-life advisors. Meanwhile, traditional investment firms such as Charles Schwab and Vanguard are offering entry-level automated investing services that are also intended to funnel new clients to human advisors. And independent advisors are joining industry networks that equip their operations with many of the functions and efficiencies of robo-advisors.Even staunchly traditional wealth managers are warming up to backroom robo-advisor-like services, says Stuart DePina, group vice president for Envestnet, a Chicago-based investment platform that is used by 40,000 advisory firms. While retired clients probably won’t cotton to getting their investment advice mainly through an online portal, those clients’ less wealthy children and grandchildren might love the digital service, DePina says. Traditional advisors view the automated services as a way to “scale their business,” he says. “Smart firms are realizing that this is a way for me to get a foot in the door with clients that are building assets.”That means a well-established advisor might be very open to a hybrid approach for clients with several hundred thousand dollars in assets, DePina says.One way to open the conversation and signal that you are looking for more than a robo-advisor but less than a full-fledged traditional relationship is to ask, “Does your firm offer a function that helps me self-manage my account?” DePina recommends.Use terms like “digital advice platform” to talk the advisor’s industry lingo. Or just come right out and say that you have or are considering an account with a robo-advisor but still need some guidance from a human advisor.Meanwhile, some advisors and industry experts have reservations about the short track record and less-than-universal relevance of robo-advisors. In early May, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an investor warning about automated investment services, advising individuals to scrutinize the underlying assumptions about projected returns.Some experts point out that robo-advisors have only been operating in a bull market and haven’t yet been tested during a downturn.And robo-advisors assume a substantial amount of investor knowledge and confidence, experts say. Robo-advisors are great if you already know what you’re doing and just need an efficient technology to put your plan into action, says John Diehl, senior vice president of strategic markets for Hartford Funds.But if you aren’t sure what you need – either now or in the future – you are on your own. “The robo-advisor platform gives people information, but it doesn’t give them conversation,” Diehl says. ”You need a conversation with a person to either challenge or confirm what you’re thinking. The robo-advisor will ask you questions and make recommendations accordingly. But are you asking the right questions? And what if you have questions that it can’t answer? Who do you talk with?”A recent survey of 500 consumers sponsored by Hartford Funds found that most clients of financial advisors want more, rather than less, information. For instance, 22 percent reported that they wanted advisors to spend more time explaining financial planning strategy and how to improve lagging investments.Robo-advisors are already changing clients’ expectations, says Steve Scanlon, co-founder of Dallas-based Guardvest, an online consumer feedback service for investment advisors. The robo-advisors openly discuss fees and options for additional services, he says. “You’ll get a look into your portfolio that you don’t get with an advisor. The downside is that they’ll try to sell you on other services,” Scanlon says.Potential clients are realizing that they need to ask both robo-advisors and human advisors the same questions before handing over their portfolios, Scanlon adds. “If you’re facing significant life changes, can you trust any advisor for the first time with your assets?” he asks.And, Scanlon says, it’s also reasonable to ask a human advisor to disclose fees and projected fees to the same degree as the robo-advisors. “Most investment advisors can’t tell you exactly what it’s going to pay,” he says. “They’ll say that the base fee is, say, 1 percent of assets under management, but there are loads, markups, markdowns and transaction fees as well. The real question is what are you paying in total to have your money managed? It could be as much as 2.7 percent. That’s why you have to look at your actual return, not the market averages for fees.”;Wealth Management;http://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/mutual-funds/articles/2015/06/04/the-ideal-financial-advisor-part-human-part-droid
374;The recent rise of the robo-advisor has created quite a stir among financial advisors and raised questions among consumers about whether this type of automated solution is truly a viable alternative to human advice.Robo-advisors are computer-based investment programs that design and maintain portfolios for consumers according to assessments of their risk tolerance. Fees to use a robo-advisor are a fraction of the roughly 1% of assets under management that human advisors charge. Initially, this service was only offered by startups, but now some large firms are offering robo-platforms, including my firm’s broker/dealer, LPL Financial.All of this attention has sparked a robust debate about the long-term effectiveness of robo-advice versus that of traditional advice. The two are often presented as being at odds with one another, but they don’t have to be.The argument for the robo-model raises the question: Why pay 1% to an advisor to build an asset allocation and invest in a basket of mutual funds or ETFs when a sophisticated computer program can do the same thing for next to nothing? It’s a good question, but the value proposition of robo-advice depends on two things: investors acting rationally through all market cycles and technology’s ability to accurately gauge an investor’s risk tolerance.Selective amnesiaThe unprecedented run-up of the markets since the bottom of the last recession in March 2009 has caused selective amnesia among many investors, helping to create a perfect environment for robo-advice. Those of us who have been through multiple recessions understand the psychology of a downturn, especially the difficulty investors have fending off the ceaseless negativity that surrounds them during those periods. The idea that clients with automated investment solutions will be able to just tune out the noise and stick to the program during such tough times seems optimistic at best.Even modest corrections cause some investors to overreact. When September statements came out, many portfolios showed declines of  2% to 5%, prompting quite a few nervous emails and phone calls to my office, despite constant reminders that corrections and recessions are natural, even necessary, parts of market cycles.When the chaos of the next market downturn reaches a fever pitch, many robo-advisor clients will undoubtedly find themselves longing for experienced guidance that might keep them from making emotional decisions that could well ruin their portfolios.Risk toleranceOver the past few years, I’ve noticed that when the market goes essentially straight up for multiple years in a row, investors tend to overstate their risk tolerance. The reality is that a client’s true appetite for risk is often a moving target and is very hard to gauge from a 10-question form or even an hourlong conversation. Learning an investor’s risk tolerance takes seeing how she reacts to different market conditions, so it’s unlikely that many of the risk-tolerance profiles used by robo-advisors are entirely accurate.This inaccuracy increases the likelihood of negative emotional responses by these investors in times of extreme market volatility. Combined with a lack of experienced, human guidance, it could result in adverse outcomes for individual investors who may make rash decisions.Can’t we all just get along?What’s lost in the narrative about robo-advisors is that a good advisor should provide much more than portfolio performance. In my practice, I consider the performance of the investment portfolios to be a secondary concern. If advisors are doing their jobs right, investments will in time do what they’re supposed to. Advisors need to more clearly articulate what we do so that clients can fully understand what they’re missing if they use a robo-advisor: expert guidance, customized advice and, importantly, an accurate evaluation of the client’s risk tolerance.I believe that eventually, robo-technology will end up being more of a tool for traditional advisors than a stand-alone alternative to them.Perhaps then it won’t be robo-advisor versus human advisor, but rather, robo-advisor and human advisor.;Wealth Management;http://www.nasdaq.com/article/for-financial-advisors-roborivals-could-turn-into-resources-cm541005
375;"BofA spokeswoman Anne Pace told Bloomberg the bank sees an opportunity “for a robo-advised offering that could complement the advice and guidance offered by our financial solutions advisers.”People close to the matter told Bloomberg that BofA will unroll the services in 2016.Competing Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE: WFC) said this summer it’s also considering adding automated investment services.      CFO John Shrewsberry said the bank has a number of initiatives“underway in that business to modernize and to create service capability to attract new investors and to better serve the investors that we have” on a conference call to go over Wells Fargo's second-quarter earnings.""It will turn up in our mobile and online offerings that allow people to do more for themselves. And at some point, it could even include service or capability that competes with some of the sort of the robo-advisory people out there today who rely primarily on technology to construct portfolios and make offerings to customers,"" Shrewsberry said.BofA’s decision to add robo advisers come as wealth managers are doing more to attract millennial investors";Wealth Management;http://www.bizjournals.com/southflorida/blog/morning-edition/2015/11/bank-of-america-is-embracing-the-robot.html
376;The fourth quarter often spells trouble for financial advisers at wirehouses and the other big-box firms of wealth management. This is the time of year when the boss, the boss’s boss and sometimes even the CEO explain to a packed auditorium of advisers why a pay cut is a good thing.Whatever the latest payout machinations are—whether they affect commissions, fee-based revenue or incentives attached to margin loans—the impact is invariably the same. Next year, when the advisers and their sales assistants divide their W-2 income by their annual production, the resulting quotient will be lower than the same calculation for this year.Here’s my two cents for anyone in the corner office at one of the big brokerages: The competitive landscape for wealth management has never been tougher. The resources available for registered investment advisers have never been greater. And unless you want to turn your sales force into a training program for breakaway advisers, forget the pay cuts and focus on your platform.;Wealth Management;http://www.wsj.com/articles/a-word-to-brokerage-executives-about-that-pay-cut-1446130011
377;"Automated investment services promise to make investing easy, inexpensive, and even fun.  Sometimes called robo advisors, these companies can take the pain and uncertainty out of investing by constructing a portfolio, investing in ETFs, rebalancing, reinvesting dividends, and even harvesting tax losses.On the surface robo advisors appear to be virtually identical. Popular options such as Betterment and WealthFront offer a diversified portfolio of low cost ETFs. All an investor needs to do is choose a stock and bond allocation, and the robo advisor does the rest.A closer look, however, reveals some significant differences from one service to the next. Key differences include the following:•Cost: The cost of automated investing services range from free to 50 basis points or more;•Custody: Some services require you to transfer your money to their custodian, while others allow you to keep your investments at well know brokerages;•Account Types: While all offer taxable accounts and IRA retirement accounts, they don’t all offer SEP IRA accounts for the self-employed;•Investments: Some limit investors to the ETFs selected by the service, while others offer more flexibility;•Taxes: Some services offer sophisticated tax loss harvesting features, while others do not; and•Stocks: Some services allow you to invest in individual stocks, although most do not.These differences are important. Selecting the robo advisor that best meets an investor’s needs requires understanding the different features and costs of these services.  For that reason, below you’ll find an extensive list of popular robo advisors and the key features and costs of each.Note that I have accounts with or have used Betterment, WealthFront, WiseBanyan, Personal Capital, Motif Investing, FutureAdvisor and Blooom.Fully Automated Investment ServicesSeveral robo advisors handle virtually every aspect of investing. Once money is transferred to a new account and a stock/bond allocation chosen, the service handles everything from rebalancing to dividend reinvestment to even tax loss harvesting. These services don’t offer much flexibility. The ETFs and asset allocation, for example, are determined by the advisor. What they lack in flexibility, however, they make up with the ease of using their service.Betterment:  One of the first robo advisors, Betterment (review of Betterment) has built a robust set of tools to help the most novice of investors. One need only select how much they want invested in stock ETFs and how much in bond ETFs. Betterment provides easy to use tools to help investors make the stock/bond allocation decision. Once made, Betterment allocates the investments across several low cost ETFs.Betterment’s asset allocation favors value ETFs. It does not include REITs or Commodity ETFs on the theory that total market ETFs provide exposure to these asset classes. Taxable accounts of at least $50,000 can take advantage of Betterment’s automated tax loss harvesting tools.There is no minimum deposit to open an account. The fees charged, however, range from 0.15% to 0.35% based on the account balance. The lowest fee of 0.15% is available for accounts with $100,000 or more.Betterment’s most notable feature is its website. It offers beautifully designed tools that make understanding investments a joy";Wealth Management;http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertberger/2015/02/05/7-robo-advisors-that-make-investing-effortless/3/
378;WealthFront: This automated investment service has Burton Malkiel as its Chief Investment Officer. WealthFront (interview with WealthFront’s CEO) offers features similar to Betterment, although there are several notable differences. It’s management fee is 0.25% of assets over $10,000, in addition to the ETF fees. It also requires a minimum deposit of $500 to open an account.WealthFront takes a traditional approach to asset allocation. Specifically, it includes ETFs that invest in REITs (VNQ) and dividend stocks (VIG). It also avoids U.S. government bond funds given the current yields. WealthFront also takes a unique approach to tax loss harvesting. Those with at least $100,000 invested in a taxable account can take advantage of WealthFront Direct Indexing:“ Instead of using a single ETF or Index Fund to invest in U.S. stocks, Wealthfront’s Tax-Optimized Direct Indexing directly purchases up to 1,001 individual securities on your behalf — up to 1,000 stocks from the S&P 500 and S&P 1500 indices and an ETF of much smaller companies. This allows us to take advantage of the countless opportunities for tax-loss harvesting presented by the movement of individual stocks, to further improve your investment performance. Combined with our Daily Tax-Loss Harvesting service, we believe this could add as much as 2.03% to your annual investment performance.;Wealth Management;http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertberger/2015/02/05/7-robo-advisors-that-make-investing-effortless/3/
379;WiseBanyan: This robo advisor offers an interesting twist–it’s free. The good folks at WiseBanyan (interview of WiseBanyan’s co-founder) believe that asset allocation is a commodity that they can offer at no charge (the ETFs still charge a fee) while making money by selling add-ons. One such add-on which will launch soon is tax loss harvesting. But for those with retirement accounts that can’t benefit from TLH, WiseBanyan should be a serious consideration.Robo Advisors That Work With Existing Brokerage AccountsThere are several automated advisors that do not require investors to transfer funds out of existing accounts. Instead, the advisor manages the asset allocation, rebalancing and dividend reinvestment from within an existing account. These services also offer asset allocation advice for those who prefer to manage their own accounts.;Wealth Management;http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertberger/2015/02/05/7-robo-advisors-that-make-investing-effortless/3/
380;FutureAdvisor: Working with Fidelity and TD Ameritrade, FutureAdvisor (FutureAdvisor review) offers a robust investment evaluation tool. Users can connect their existing investment accounts to FutureAdvisor’s tool for free. FutureAdvisor then evaluates the investments based on performance, diversification, fees, and taxes.In addition, FutureAdvisor recommends changes to an investor’s asset allocation. Its recommendations walk through which existing investments should be sold, what new investments should be purchased, and why. The tool even allows investors to reject some of the recommendations, in which case FutureAdvisor will reevaluate the remaining investment recommendations. The tool considers the tax consequences of selling an investment as part of its evaluation.For an annual fee of 0.50%, FutureAdvisor will implement the recommendations, including future rebalancing and dividend reinvestment. For those with a Fidelity 401(k) that offers BrokerageLink, FutureAdvisor can also manage an investor’s 401(k).;Wealth Management;http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertberger/2015/02/05/7-robo-advisors-that-make-investing-effortless/3/
381;Blooom: Unique among robo advisors, Blooom helps investors manage 401(k) retirement accounts. This presents two significant challenges. First, the service must be able to work with countless firms managing 401(k) retirement accounts. Second, it must be able to work with the investment options available in each 401(k). Blooom has managed to overcome both challenges.Users can connect their 401(k) to Blooom and generate an analysis of their investments. Blooom uses the image of a flower to show its evaluation. A beautiful flower means the investments are spot on in Blooom’s opinion. A wilted flower with a fly on it means there’s work to be done. Blooom then recommends changes to the portfolio.;Wealth Management;http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertberger/2015/02/05/7-robo-advisors-that-make-investing-effortless/3/
382;When it comes to investing, there is no shortage of strategies. Through a variety of resources from books to television to online, potential investors are inundated with information on the topic.The trick for any investor is how to turn that overload of investing information into a long-term investment strategy that will allow them to achieve their financial goals. For most people, those goals include paying for their children’s education and their own retirement.Before beginning investing, most executives and employees have to decide what they are planning for. While there are any number of investment approaches, advisors focused on several key strategies to improve long-term results.“Usually, the questions I get are, will I have enough [money] to retire, or, how much money will I need to retire?” said Brian Loy, a financial advisor with Sage Financial Advisors Inc.Loy added that one thing is sure, “you’ll need more money than you think you will.” He also attributed the increased cost of retirement to people living longer.According to Loy, on average people are living 30 years after they retire. With $2 million saved and living off 4 percent annually. That amounts to an income of $80,000.“At 65, most people will live for three more decades,” Loy explained. “That’s a long time. Maybe you need to work to 68 or 70 instead of 65.” Loy said part of any comprehensive investment strategy is knowing “if your goal is out of reach, you’ll need to adjust your expectations.”Among the many investment strategies is market timing. Simply defined, when an investor should get into the stock market, or maybe sell some shares or exit a fund.Is it a popular strategy with financial advisors? No, but many times market timing is driven by investor fear. Whether the market is experiencing a downward trend and investors want to sell their shares, or finding an investment that has outperformed the market and buying at its peak.Loy stressed that an investment strategies should, “not be driven by the market, but by what you need.”Market timing is an attempt to buy low and sell high. However, it’s difficult to know when the market is about to turn higher or lower. Staci Scharadin, CEO of Las Vegas-based Diamond Wealth Management, explained that, all too often, it’s difficult for investors to know when the market is reaching its peak, followed by the inevitable sell off and steep decline.“Investors who try to time the market may have success in the short term,” said Scharadin. “But, over the long term, it is a difficult strategy to be successful with.”Mitigating Investment RisksAdvisors also urge their clients to review their asset allocation. Asset allocation is simply a strategy that attempts to balance risk versus reward by adjusting the percentage of each asset in a portfolio.For example, a typical portfolio may be 60 percent invested in stocks, 20 percent in bonds and 20 percent in alternative investments.“For a 50-year-old executive with a Las Vegas company, typically they are still investing for retirement,” Scharadin said. “They might want to look outside the market, use alternative investments. These are investments not tied to the emotional ups and downs of the market.”Scharadin said these alternative investments, which some call non-traded investments, include business development corporations, venture capital, private equity, hedge funds, real estate investment trusts, as well as real assets such as precious metals, rare coins and art.These assets usually perform with low correlation to stocks and bonds, and are generally more illiquid than traditional investments. Liquid alternatives include ETFs, or an exchange traded fund and mutual funds that are traded publically.“Because alternative investments are assets that are usually not correlated to the stock market, you’ll see the use of self-directed IRAs and allocations to alternative investments rise,” said Theresa Fette, CEO of Provident Trust Group in Las Vegas. “We have seen increased investments in rental real estate and private companies mostly in the last year.”Fette said her company is specifically seeing a growth of investments in first deeds of trust and private companies in Nevada. But what are the various risks investors take when investing in alternatives and do the risks outweigh the rewards?“There is risk in all investments,” Fette explained. “To minimize risk, we see our clients diversifying their portfolio among a variety of assets, including traditional assets such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Clients need to remember that there is usually a direct correlation between the amount of risk and the amount of return.”Fette noted the higher the risk, the higher the return. She also cautioned investors to do their due diligence before choosing an investment. In other words, if there’s a claim of 10 percent returns, don’t just jump in to make the investment.Fette cited Bloomberg News saying the average investor realizes approximately 3.7 percent returns.“If you can understand and appreciate the risks involved with any investment, and live with the consequences if any of those risks were to play out, that is usually a good litmus test to determine if it is too risky for you personally,” she said.Scharadin added alternative investments are good for removing “some of the risk from the markets.” She recommended that 15 to 25 percent of a client’s portfolio be placed in alternative investments.Scharadin noted that Yale and Harvard universities have 60 to 80 percent of their endowments in alternative investments. She said these alternative investments have “come down to the retail level,” with a minimum of $5,000 invested. Demand for alternative investments stems from investor appetite for lower volatility and diversification. Another reason is the fact that regulatory and financial barriers that kept many small investors away have been relaxed in recent years.For years, these investments were primarily available to institutional investors or the very wealthy because it meant setting aside large amounts of capital for a very long time. Now there are options with lower minimums such as mutual funds, as well as hedge funds that allow investors to withdraw cash more frequently.Investment Strategies That WorkOther keys to success include investing early and separating emotions from objectives. Those strategies should include investing in things that are familiar. For example, if a person gambles and spends lots of time and money at casinos in Nevada, advisors will tell them to consider investing in the gaming sector or a particular company.Another key is to start investing as early as possible. The longer money is invested, the more potential it has to grow and bring the best returns. Also, remember dollar-cost averaging, the process of investing a fixed amount of money in an investment vehicle at regular intervals, typically bi-weekly or monthly.Scharadin urged investors to be disciplined, continue to invest over an extended period of time, regardless of prices or the ups and downs of the market.“Don’t get caught up in the hype,” Scharadin said. “Stay on track with your contributions”. In 2008, people got scared, took their money out of the market and never came back. Then in 2014, at the height of the rally, everyone wanted to get back in.”Loy agreed, saying discipline was key to successful investing, but so is rebalancing a portfolio. Over time, a portfolio’s risk profile may adjust due to the performance of certain investments or economy.Despite Nevada’s ongoing economic recovery, Loy said he still “finds a lot of people rebuilding their portfolios.”“The recession had a huge impact on their businesses,” Loy said. “For executives or employees who were laid off or furloughed during the recession, it’s time to regroup. When it comes to rebuilding your portfolio, it’s also about being aggressive. Who is saving more?”Loy also urged investors to aggressively budget their money, or maybe even downsize their lifestyle to get a handle on their finances.Post-Recession Investing in NevadaAfter adjusting your portfolio or looking to get back into the market, what do executives need to know when it comes to investing in the post-recession environment?“Whether you’re investing during a recession or a booming economy, it should start with a financial plan that takes your individual situation and goals into account,” said James Corey, vice president and branch manager with Charles Schwab in Southern Nevada. “Most business executives would not start a new venture without a business plan. It should be the same thing for investing.”Corey, who oversees offices in Las Vegas, Summerlin and Henderson, admitted the global market concerns and uncertainty over when the Federal Reserve will begin to raise interest rates have created a “great deal of volatility in the market.”“For long-term investors, which most of us are, it’s important to stay focused on the longer term and not be too distracted by shorter term events,” Corey said.Trusting a Machine with Your SavingsThere has been a lot of reports about “robo-advisors.” These automated investment services promise to make investing easy and inexpensive. Typically, a robo-advisor firm provides portfolio management online and no other financial advice, whereas financial planners with more traditional brokerage or wealth management firms provide advice on topics such as insurance, retirement and estate planning.With a robo-advisor service, the portfolio management is provided through the use of computer models based on basic online goal and risk tolerance assessment tools.Robo-advisors are operated by well-known brokerage firms and by relatively new names to the industry – FutureAdvisor, Beterment and Wealthfront. Schwab Intelligent Portfolios launched earlier this year.The paperless platform is available to clients with as little as $5,000 and is free to investors. Before building the portfolio, it takes a client through a 14-question “Investor Profile Questionnaire,” which is designed to capture their behavioral attitude toward risk, which creates a risk willingness score.Finally, users are asked questions about their age and investment product preferences, which help determine the appropriate set of portfolios.“We think the introduction of automated investing services as an evolution in the industry, as opposed to a revolution,” Corey said. “An automated investing service like this can be appropriate for an investor who is looking for a different way to invest and who is comfortable using technology to make things more efficient.”He described Intelligent Portfolios’ client base as half millennials or Gen-X, who are just getting started with investing, while about half are Baby Boomers and Matures. Corey said roughly 15 percent of their clients have $1 million or more invested with Schwab overall.“Robo-advisory services will be mainstream over the next three to five years,” consulting firm A.T. Kearney concluded in a recent report. By 2020, robo advisors will manage $2 trillion in the U.S., or 5.6 percent of Americans’ investment assets up from 0.5 percent today, the report predicted.Scharadin added that robo-advisors are here to stay but that personal service will remain important.“Who are people going to talk to?” Scharadin questioned. “When they are scared, they want to speak with someone. In my world, I’m reaching out to those who might use robo advisors. That personal service is never going to go away.”;Wealth Management;http://www.nevadabusiness.com/2015/11/investment-strategies-designing-the-perfect-portfolio/

384;"The digital advice market is expected to grow to nearly $500 billion in the next four years, according to Cerulli Associates.Yet despite predictions of a booming market just around the corner, many of the largest brokerage firms are unsure whether they want to jump in.The heads of Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo said in recent interviews that they were looking at how to get into the market.  Meanwhile, the leaders of Raymond James and Edward Jones have sworn off robos, saying they didn't want to cannibalize their advisors.A key factor in how firms are approaching this developing market is whether the company is already serving direct investors, experts say.Bank of America, for example, has Merrill Lynch and Merrill Edge, its call center service for direct investors, says Sophie Schmitt, an analyst at research firm Aite Group. It's a natural evolution for the company to move towards a robo advisor or similar service.""In the scheme of things it's not that different from what they are doing with the Merrill Edge advisory center. Perhaps it'll be a cheaper rate than what you can do currently with an advisor. For them it's another product,"" Schmitt says.John Thiel, head of Merrill Lynch Wealth Management, highlighted the company's existing capabilities when discussing how they would implement a robo advisor service.""It would be stand-alone if clients want to self-direct,"" Thiel says. ""We have that option today in Merrill Edge. So to me, it’s very analogous to direct investing, where someone feels like the algorithm is what they are looking for in a relationship, and they don’t see behavioral advice or financial planning — what we see as very important — as important to them, at least at this moment.""STRATEGIC SENSELike Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo has multiple lines of business. Both companies are serving tens of millions of Americans on multiple levels, from credit cards to mortgages to investment accounts.Another factor, often overlooked, is the overseas markets. For example, the Toronto-based RBC and Zurich-based UBS have retail banking services in their home markets and others, and they're facing additional competitive pressures from firms overseas that are developing robo advisors and other digital offerings, Schmitt says.""Robo advisor is a very narrow thing, in my opinion. It's like Betterment. Some of these are not Betterment, but they are offering [digital] advice,"" says Schmitt, who notes that the U.K. has one of the more developed digital advice markets.For firms such as Raymond James or Edward Jones, which have thousands of financial advisors across U.S., it may not make a lot of strategic sense to begin competing for the direct investors' dollars.""We think we offer value in guidance and advice,"" says Jim Weddle, head of Edward Jones. ""An 800-number and algorithm isn't going to replace our folks.""But that doesn't exclude the possibility — and necessity — of upgrading the digital services offered to clients. Weddle says that ""robo advisors will push everyone, us included, forward in terms of the quality of the tools and the functionality of the desktop to benefit the advisor.""";Wealth Management;http://www.onwallstreet.com/news/industry/digital-advices-expected-billions-not-enough-for-some-firms-2694723-1.html
385;As their current clients age, brokerages and advisers are trying to appeal to a younger demographic, including the much-talked-about millennials. But it will be decades before that cohort, commonly defined as those between 18 and 34 this year, has big money, says Wealth Adviser at WSJ.com in reporting on a new study. The research by the Deloitte Center for Financial Services, a unit of Deloitte Consulting LLP, suggests millennials will account for less than 20% of total U.S. wealth at least through 2030. Indeed, at that point, baby boomers (those between 51 and 69 this year) will still have the biggest share of the country’s wealth, although that share will be declining while that of Generation X (those currently ages 35 to 50)  rises. After the boomers, Gen X “will become the next big fee pool for financial services firms,” the Deloitte report says.PLANNING & INVESTING:Donor-advised funds see strong growth. More individuals appear to be using donor-advised funds as part of their tax and charitable-giving strategies, Wealth Adviser at WSJ.com reports. Contributions jumped 14.1% in 2014 to $19.7 billion, spurred in part by the strong stock market, according to an annual report by National Philanthropic Trust to be released Tuesday. Market gains also helped boost the value of dollars already in the funds by 23.9% to $70.7 billion, National Philanthropic Trust said. Stephanie Lee, a financial planner in San Francisco, notes that the funds are useful for people who are about to retire: These people can donate in a high-income year and get a big tax deduction, without having to direct all the money to specific charitable recipients right away. More people are donating real estate, closely held stock and stock in young companies that haven’t yet gone public, National Philanthropic Trust says.Ways to harvest losses but stay invested. There are a couple of strategies available to investors who want to sell, for tax reasons, securities that have gone down since purchase but who also want to maintain similar exposure in their portfolios. One option is to “double up” on a holding for more than 30 days before selling the initial stake, notes an article on year-end strategies in The Wall Street Journal’s Investing in Funds & ETFs report. Investors also are permitted under tax rules to deduct a loss if they sell an actively managed sector mutual fund and buy a similar fund from another company, says David Levi, senior managing director in Minneapolis for CBIZ MHM LLC, a professional-services concern. Another option: sell a losing stock to buy an exchange-traded fund that tracks that market sector.THE BUSINESS:Wall Street braces for lower bonuses. Securities-industry bonuses are expected to drop for the first time in four years as financial firms reel from a choppy 2015, according to a closely watched study from consulting firm Johnson Associates Inc. reported by The Wall Street Journal.  “It’s been such an uncertain year, a stressful year. Pay is down moderately, but it feels worse,” says Alan Johnson, managing director at New York-based Johnson Associates. Pay trends vary by business segment. Bonuses to advisers of wealthy individuals are expected to be flat to down 5%.RCS Capital RCAP -46.24% evaluating options after Apollo deal collapses. Brokerage firm RCS Capital Corp. said it is seeking a buyer and raising capital in the wake of a collapsed deal for Apollo Global Management LLCAPO -1.84% to buy $19 billion in assets from real-estate executive Nicholas Schorsch. On Monday, RCS said two Apollo officials resigned from the RCS board of directors, The Wall Street Journal reported. RCS said it hired Lazard Freres & Co. LLC to explore ways to raise capital. It also said it would sell Hatteras, its liquid-alternatives investment management platform, to Hatteras Funds management for $5.5 million and the assumption of certain earn-out obligations.Merrill brokers managing $700 million go independent. Advisers Ross Fox, Matthew Papazian, Marti Awad and Sarah Keys resigned from the Bank of America Corp.-owned brokerage on Monday and launched their own practice, Cardan Capital Partners, in Denver, Wealth Adviser at WSJ.com reported. Mr. Papazian, a 26-year veteran of Merrill, says he and his partners “wanted to place a bet on ourselves and get equity in ourselves.” They are launching the firm with the support of New York-based Dynasty Financial Partners.United Capital grows through acquisitions. United Capital Financial Advisers announced Monday it was adding more than $1.5 billion in assets through two acquisitions, according to InvestmentNews. PSA Insurance & Financial Services of Hunt Valley, Md., has a retirement-plans practice with $1.1 billion in assets under advisement and a wealth-management practice with about $189 million in assets under management, the publication said. Select Financial Group has $270 million in assets under advisement.THE PRACTICE:SEC warns funds and advisers of risks in outsourcing compliance.In some cases of funds and advisers using third-party compliance firms, the Securities and Exchange Commission said it found that outside compliance officers sometimes were left in the dark about a firm’s business practices, didn’t have access to company documents and didn’t communicate regularly with the firm’s principals, according to InvestmentNews. In an alert dated Monday, the SEC said some standardized checklists used by outsourced compliance officers didn’t appear to “fully capture the business models, practices, strategies and compliance risks that were applicable” to the firms. By contrast, it said outsourced compliance officers “who frequently and personally interacted with advisory and fund employees” appeared to have a better understanding of the firms’ businesses, operations and risks.;Wealth Management;http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/11/10/wealth-adviser-daily-briefing-dont-overlook-gen-x-and-its-money/
386;If the financial industry wants to provide more Americans with advice, it should try to meet them where they already are.That’s the rationale behind NextCapital’s latest upgrade to its 401(k) digital advice platform. The new features allow its platform to replace target-date funds as the default option in 401(k) plans and offer more holistic advice to savers.“These plans are the primary place where 88 million American save for retirement,” says Rob Foregger, co-founder of NextCapital. “We thought ‘Why not create a digital advice experience around their 401(k)?’ That’s what’s unique about our model, it starts with the 401(k), but allows account aggregation, driving that level of personalization for consumers. Our customers, mostly large financial institutions, can now rapidly bring to market full-stack digital advice solutions using their own methodologies.”NextCapital is an enterprise digital advice provider whose strategies are currently used by TransAmerica and Russell Investments. The upgrade transforms the front end of NextCapital’s software to offer holistic retirement advice for 401(k) plans.Foregger, who also co-founded digital advice provider Personal Capital and the direct-to-consumer EverBank, says that the new platform will help expose a larger segment of investors to digital advice and retirement planning services.“What they want is personalized advice that can be scalable and low cost,” Foregger says. “Technology is taking us beyond manufactured products and towards personalized solutions.”Foregger also hopes the new offering will bring 401(k) management more in line with the Department of Labor’s proposed fiduciary rule.“The Department of Labor is asking for something more from the industry,” Foregger says. “Target-date funds were a good solution 10 years ago, but now technology is in place to deliver all these important components into an individual account. Target-date funds are a semi-personalized vehicle, there’s currently $800 billion invested in them, and there’s another $80 billion going into them each year as qualified default investment alternatives.”NextCapital’s platform incorporates open architecture to allow institutions to use their proprietary investment methodologies and reduce implementation risk. The software connects to 401(k) recordkeeping systems to create an accessible platform, which enables bulk re-enrollment as the plan’s qualified default investment alternative.“Where the Department of Labor is trying to push the industry is what I call ‘defined contribution 2.0,’” Foregger says. “We’re moving back towards a more delegated solution, where customers delegate savings and portfolio advice to a professional who manages these accounts in a low-cost, personalized way.”The new platform includes portfolio tracking and account aggregation. It also allows plan participants to manage their entire financial picture. Built-in tools calculate retirement savings rates and offer portfolio recommendations, a wealth and spend-down forecast, and a Social Security projection.Participants can track savings and investments through a dashboard that provides performance, risk, asset allocation and forecasting metrics. Access to recordkeeping systems like Sungard’s Omni suite enables participants to use automation to escalate their savings rate over time, rebalance, and establish asset allocation glide paths to prepare them for retirement.“This universal access to 401(k) record systems is what our partners need,” Foregger says. “This allows us to integrate data and plan rules and enable real-time advice.”Additionally, NextCapital’s OpenEngine advice system allows partners to provide their world-class advice methodology inside of the NextCapital Digital Advice Platform.;Wealth Management;http://www.fa-mag.com/news/nextcapital-upgrades-to-bring-holistic-planning-to-401-k--sphere-23190.html
387;"“Robos a no go,” …. “Is Robo less friend than foe?”These types of headlines and sentiments seem to be prevailing among a large portion of advisors reluctant to give up or supplement investment management with the latest technology innovation.Take heed, there’s real grounding in advisor apprehension. Moving to a digital advice provider presents questions surrounding pricing and performance.  What will keep clients from moving to a cheaper platform and jettisoning the advisor relationship, and what if the Robo Advisor outperforms the advisor?As with many things tech-related, what seems a fear factor often becomes a helpful common practice that frees people up to focus on the things a computer can’t do. Hiding from technology never works.  It will in time become the prevailing practice.  So why not embrace it on some level?  Using a digital advice provider is not an all-or- nothing sum game.  In certain commoditized sectors of the markets, such as developed market equity and bonds, ask yourself, does it really add client value to spend your time on investment management.  What would you do with the extra time if you had it?At a recent New York Society of Security Analysts author series meeting, Institute for Private Investors Founder Charlotte B. Beyer encouraged advisors to embrace technology.  Using Robo Advisors can create more time for an advisor to build the partnership relationships the ultra-affluent now seek and expect.  “Is Robo eviscerating the advisor business?   I don’t think so,” Ms. Beyer said.Five PracticesHere are five practices advisors can employ to build partnerships with their clients, excerpted from the new book, Wealth Management Unwrapped, by Ms. Beyer.1.Take the time at the start of a potential engagement to determine if the potential client is a proper fit for your practice.  Have clients discuss their investment sophistication and need for control.  Compare where they fall compared to your most successful relationships.2.Determine who are the decision-makers in the family.  Be aware of all family dynamics.3.Craft an investment policy statement covering the purpose of the wealth in your portfolio; the target return and risk levels; the asset allocation needed to achieve goals; triggers for rebalancing or resetting allocations; and what investments are allowed or aren’t permissible.4.Determine clear benchmarks, model them and explain why one is chosen versus another.5.Keep an ongoing open dialogue with your clients.  Find out what they’re happy with and where they see need for improvement.  Turn areas of discontent into a positive.  For example, if a client finds meetings too long, create tight, clear agendas and monitor time.  Or, if clients find reports long and confusing, craft executive summaries that are consistent and easily comparable.";Wealth Management;http://wealthmanagement.com/client-relations/five-ways-build-client-partnerships
388;Investment professionals still don’t quite know was to make of robo-advisors. By and large, they are still figuring out whether they’re competition, complementary or even relevant at all.Research released by Pershing delves into the world of the investment advisor in the current day. Entitled The Third Annual Study of Advisory Success: Confidence and Concern in the New Digital Age and released at Pershing’s INSITE 2015 conference on Wednesday, the study delves investment technology and its implications for industry players.Investigators surveyed and conducted 350 interviews with RIAs, wirehouse advisors and other advisors (such as those working in insurance agencies, independent broker-dealers or banks). They asked respondents about the state of their businesses, the risks and rewards of their jobs, confidence levels and the digital landscape.Nearly half of respondents said that their business is “doing better than ever before,” and only a few admitted they were “struggling.” The most rewarding aspects of being a financial advisor reported were helping clients meet financial goals, having clients who appreciate the value provided, and helping clients make the right financial decisions. Not only are financial advisors happy with what they’ve accomplished, but they are also confident about the field overall. Half of advisors believe they have achieved the highest tier of professional success, and 73% are satisfied with their careers. Moreover, 44% of respondents said they would recommend the field to their children or another young person.Less Consensus on Robo-AdvisorsInvestment advisors appear to be more or less on the same page regarding the current state of their businesses. However, when it comes to the technological aspects of the field, there is a bit more variety.Digital advisors – also known as automated investment services, automated wealth managers and robo-advisors – utilize automated tools to suggest and manage investments, taking into account factors like investment goals and risk tolerance levels. They are cost-effective and according to Pershing charge 0.25% to 0.75% of assets, compared to the 1% to 3% fee typically applied by traditional advisors. Automatic services also have very low – and, at times, non-existent – account minimums.So what do investment professionals think about them?Pershing researchers found that most are somewhat familiar with robo-advisors. About a quarter of respondents said they had only ever heard the name.Of those who had heard of digital advise, 23% believe it is competition to their practice, and 27% say it is irrelevant. Just 19% think digital advice can be complementary, while 30% haven’t yet made up their minds.Robo-AdvisorsAdvisors seem to agree that digital online financial solutions providers will pose some sort of a threat to their practice over the next five years. While 55% think the threat will be minor, 18% say it will be major. They are most concerned about price, especially if robo-solutions offer in-person or remote access to a human advisor for an additional fee.However, advisors acknowledge opportunity in what’s to come as well. Sixty-seven percent of respondents believe asset-allocation-suggesting algorithms represent opportunity, 52% say low-cost digital delivery of advise is an opportunity, and 62% are optimistic about automatic tax harvesting capabilities.They are also aware that they may need to add services to their offers to remain competitive, relevant and profitable. Estate planning and financial education were among the services most often named.Robo-AdvisorsYes, financial advisors are somewhat concerned about the implications of technology on their field. However, they also believe that human advisors will continue to be a main value for clients. “Investors may gain convenience, but advisors predict that they won’t forego wisdom,” researchers write.What’s more, most have already adapted to technology in one way or another already;Wealth Management;http://www.valuewalk.com/2015/06/robo-advisors-pros-vs-cons/
389;"Financial advisors are no strangers to changing demographics. Many are aging along with their client base and are well aware of the challenges for succession plans when they retire. But until that time, advisors need to understand how demographic changes are affecting the broader economy and financial markets as well as their own business.“Demography is overwhelmingly the most important issue for the macro economy and capital markets in developed countries,” says Chris Brightman, chief investment officer of Research Affiliates.He explains that population growth, which has been around 1% in the developed world, is declining. “Japan’s population has shrunk; Europe’s is near flat and in U.S [population] growth is now about 0.6% or 0.7% and will be 0.5% in the future,” Brightman tells ThinkAdvisor.Slower population growth means slow economic growth simply because fewer people are working. That demographic along with an aging workforce, which tends to be less productive, is another bearish factor for the economy, says Brightman, noting that productivity peaks at age 50.Given these two major demographic trends “getting back to 3% to 4% economic growth like we had in the ‘70s or ‘80s is never going to happen,” says Brightman.For Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, the “biggest problem” for the U.S. economy going forward is not “unemployment but a lack of labor.” Indeed, the October jobs report released on Friday showed the unemployment rate falling to 5%, the lowest level in seven and a half years, and the labor participation rate unchanged at 62.4%, remaining at a 38-year low.  In the near term this shortage of labor could boost wages, helping hourly workers and others at the lower end of the pay scale, but it could also hurt stocks, shrinking the profit margins of companies that have to pay steeper labor costs, says Zandi. Longer term, he says a shortage of workers could “exacerbate our fiscal problems” since fewer workers will be supporting a rising increasing number of retirees.The 2015 Social Security Trustee’s report projects 2.6 workers contributing to Social Security per retiree by 2030, and just 2.2 if disability benefits are added in. In 2000 the figure was close to 4 workers per retiree.Both Zandi and Brightman tell ThinkAdvisor that increasing immigration of skilled workers could help offset these demographic trends but admit that such a change in policy is not politically possible now. Longer term, however, Zandi says U.S. immigration policy could change because “businesses will start screaming and the political opposition will fade.”Despite these pressures and slower future growth, both Zandi and Brightman are optimistic about financial markets and they are not concerned that retiring baby boomers withdrawing assets from their retirement accounts will harm markets.U.S. stocks especially are a big drawer for investors outside the U.S., says Zandi. “As large populations in the rest of the world become wealthier they will want to own a piece of the U.S. stock market.”And U.S. baby boomers, realizing they haven’t saved enough for retirement are trying to catch up, all buying assets at the same time, says Brightman. That has lowered the dividend yield of stocks to about 2% average from 4% 50, 100 and 150 years ago, and lowered bond yields. These lower yields, in turn, are sending a signal to baby boomers “to work a little longer, save a little more and maybe live more frugally in retirement than once hoped,” says Brightman.For advisors these changing demographics suggest changes in services and fees relevant for different client populations.Advisors need to learn about the psychology of older individuals and make sure clients have a support network, which bigger firms are well-positioned for, says Sophie Schmitt, senior analyst at Aite Group, an independent research and advisory firm.Merrill Lynch, for example, has partnered with the USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology to offer Ground-breaking Longevity Training Program for its financial advisors";Wealth Management;http://www.thinkadvisor.com/2015/11/09/changing-demography-to-force-big-shift-in-retireme
390;"Young entrepreneurs may not have much need for a financial adviser early on in their careers. But as their wealth grows, these individuals will eventually seek an adviser to help them manage their increasingly complex finances and guide their efforts in investing, philanthropy or providing support to family, Gerard F. Joyce, U.S. head of private wealth solutions for HSBC Private Bank, tells WSJ.com’s Wealth Adviser. To work successfully with young entrepreneurs, advisers need to be prepared to help these individuals build their financial literacy. Startup execs also may not really understand the benefits of working with an adviser; that professional needs to demonstrate his or her proficiency right away to get the entrepreneur to block out time to deal with personal financial matters, Mr. Joyce says. Mr. Joyce says a financial adviser can help these clients see the big picture and take actions that will improve their financial outlook enormously.PLANNING & INVESTING:Treasury launches new retirement account ‘myRA.’  The Treasury Department said it rolled out a new retirement-savings vehicle that is aimed at those who don’t have access to traditional retirement accounts, according to The Wall Street Journal. The retirement account, known as “myRA,” was first announced by President Barack Obama in his January 2014 State of the Union address. The new accounts are Roth IRAs, to which account holders contribute money after income taxes are paid. Investment gains and withdrawals can be tax free after that. Employees can fund the account from their paycheck, bank account or federal tax refund. They feature just one investment option, a Treasury bond with a variable interest-rate return. The program is open to workers who make less than $131,000 a year or $193,000 for those who are married and file their taxes jointly.Fiduciary proposal may give a boost to low-cost annuities. If the Labor Department’s fiduciary proposal passes, it may push advisers to look for products that offer client-friendly features and lower costs, such as cheaper annuities, writes Financial Planning. The publication writes that the rule will cause advisers to pay more attention to the lowest-cost products, which may encourage more annuity providers to compete on price. Low-cost annuities are already on the rise. Sales jumped to nearly $6 billion in 2014 from $3.6 billion in 20120, according to the Insured Retirement Institute, which defines low-cost as variable products that have no sales commissions or surrender charges and keep their annual expenses under 1%.Biggest fund-manager changes so far this year. Morningstar has compiled a list of the 10 biggest manager changes to funds managed by T. Rowe Price TROW -1.82%, Vanguard Group and others so far in 2015. Most of the changes, such as those at Vanguard Convertible Securities (VCVSX) and Perkins Mid Cap Value (JMCVX), are potentially negative for investors, Morningstar said. At the Vanguard Convertible Securities fund, for example, veteran manager Larry Keele stepped down, with Morningstar calling the loss “a blow.” Meanwhile, co-manager Jeff Kautz resigned from the Perkins fund, which has been “trying to get back on track after several years of underwhelming performance.” It called Mr. Kautz’s loss “disappointing, but not insurmountable.”THE BUSINESS: Robos projected to reach $489 billion in assets by 2020.  Robo advisory platforms are projected to increase their assets under management by more than 25-fold over the next five years, far outpacing traditional brokerages, according to InvestmentNews, citing a new report by Cerulli Associates. Tom O’Shea, an associate director at Cerulli, said robo advisory services will make that leap from the $18.7 billion they manage today as more firms build their own offerings. “The growth will be primarily driven by retail-direct firms entering that space, and also later on traditional advisers figuring out how to incorporate that spectrum of offerings,” Mr. O’Shea told the publication, adding that Cerulli believes “virtually all direct-to-consumer firms will have a digital advice offering in the next three years.”Credit Suisse CSGN.VX -1.10% broker opts for Merrill over Wells Fargo WFC -0.68%.  A Credit Suisse Group AG broker who manages more than $600 million in client assets has been hired by Merrill Lynch, passing on an opportunity to join Wells Fargo & Co, according to Wealth Adviser at WSJ.com. Adviser Nicole Primack Andres joined the Bank of America Corp.BAC -1.53%-owned brokerage in New York, a spokeswoman for the firm said. She will work within Merrill’s Private Banking & Investment Group, which caters to investors with $10 million or more in assets. Last month, Credit Suisse told Ms. Andres and her roughly 250 co-workers that it was going to shutter the unit, and that it had signed a recruiting arrangement with Wells Fargo. But dozens of top brokers from Credit Suisse were unhappy with the initial recruitment package put forward by Wells Fargo and brokerage executives said they plan to use that to lure those advisers to their firms.When clients want to fire their broker. It doesn’t happen often, but clients sometimes feel they need a new financial adviser. A study by Spectrem Group in September showed that 58% of high-net-worth investors had changed their adviser within their lifetime, while 23% did so in the past five years. In this week’s installment of The Wall Street Journal’s “Watching Your Wealth” podcast, investors are given tips on when and how they should switch advisers, advice that can also help advisers ensure they build stronger ties with clients and avoid such situations. For instance, a lack of proactive contact tends to be a key reason why clients decide they want someone else managing their finances. Similarly, advisers who go against their clients’ wishes and pursue aggressive investment strategies when a client prefers a more conservative approach can also be a deal breaker for clients";Wealth Management;http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/11/05/wealth-adviser-daily-briefing-working-with-young-entrepreneurs/
391;"""Recalibrating Value in Wealth,"" a report released today by SEI SEIC, -1.04% Scorpio Partnership and NPG Wealth Management, uncovers that America's next generation of wealthy require changes to how they pay for advisory services in the future. The report examines how America's emerging wealthy, the Futurewealthy, weigh price and value with regard to wealth management fees. As the next generation of America's wealthy grow and differ from those before them, wealth managers must continue to evolve in order to meet the preferences of the Futurewealthy. ""The Futurewealthy bring to the table new requests, different preferences and alternative needs as compared to those before them,"" said Al Chiaradonna, Senior Vice President, SEI Wealth Platform(SM), North America Private Banking. ""The traditional wealth management relationship model is challenged by these evolving needs and wealth managers are expected to deliver on value in order to deepen the relationships they have with their clients."" The Price of Value Some may assume that, as some of the world's wealthiest individuals, America's Futurewealthy are indifferent about price and do not view cost for value as an important decision in the services provided by their wealth manager, however, this is not the case. Delivering on value is one of the most important aspects of management that wealth managers must consider in order to deepen engagement with their clients. While the majority of America's Futurewealthy (84 percent) strongly agree they are receiving high-quality value for their money, the way they allocate their money to advisory services is fundamentally different. Currently, Futurewealthy use a variety of fee formats to compensate their money managers -- and they have strong opinions about how those fees should be distributed within the wealth management organization. When asked to allocate the fees they pay to different parts of their wealth experience, the Futurewealthy focused overwhelmingly on their relationship manager, choosing to allocate almost two-fifths of their whole fee to this trusted advisor; with the remainder going to the firm (20 percent), internal specialists (14 percent), supporting technologies (13 percent) and support staff (13 percent).  Given technology's growing, integral role in wealth management, there is a remarkable generational divide when it comes to preference for allocating fees toward technology. The youngest Futurewealthy, those under 40 years old, chose to allocate nearly 20 percent of their total wealth fee to supporting technologies, while only 12 percent of Futurewealthy over the age of 40 felt the same. ""It's interesting that in most cases the majority of value is placed on the relationship manager and the firm. The Futurewealthy are clearly most appreciative of the service they receive and the brand of the firm delivering it. There is a huge opportunity for wealth managers to capitalize on this growing trend by embracing technology,"" said Chiaradonna. ""Technology can enable wealth managers to broaden their capabilities and automate low value activities, while putting additional resources into strengthening their brand and their relationship managers. Additionally, the expectations of younger Futurewealthy will encourage wealth managers to grow their capabilities and further integrate technology into the client experience."" Evolving an Antiquated, Isolated Payment Structure When it comes to fee structure, the current most common choice among America's Futurewealthy is a traditional fee model, a percentage fee based on advised assets. More than one-third (35 percent) of America's Futurewealthy use this model, and preference towards this model is consistent across generations. However, when it comes to comparing preference for a fixed-fee versus a time-based, or hourly fee, there is a large generational divide. While 34 percent of the youngest Futurewealthy currently prefer a fixed-fee model, preference for this model decreases with age. Less than one-quarter (22 percent) of emerging wealthy aged 40 to 49, 10 percent of 50 to 59 year-olds and only 5 percent of those aged 60 and older currently prefer a fee-based model. Likewise, while 16 percent of the youngest Futurewealthy prefer a time-based fee model, only 4 percent of their older counterparts, aged 40 and above, prefer this option. Despite today's preferences, within the next five years, the Futurewealthy acknowledge that they would like their payment structures to evolve to better reflect their engagement with a firm. On average, 72 percent said they do not want to pay for their advisory services using a percentage of their current assets, though 40 percent of respondents currently pay this way. Instead, they want to shift to more predictable fee formats, such as time-based and fixed-rate structures. In fact, 14 percent currently pay using a fixed-fee format, however, 18 percent noted they would prefer to pay a fixed rate in the future. Additionally, while 5 percent of Futurewealthy currently pay using a time-based structure, 7 percent said they would like to pay with this structure in the future. Reshaping the Relationship Management Model Relationship managers are challenged in a new way when approaching the needs of the youngest Futurewealthy, as they expect and require a different type of service than their older counterparts. When comparing the needs of the youngest Futurewealthy to their older counterparts, the younger Futurewealthy believe they need stronger guidance, more tools and more information to make informed investment decisions. While almost half of the youngest Futurewealthy believe stronger communication between their relationship manager and firm is a necessity, only 25 percent of those aged 60 and older share the same sentiment. Beyond needing additional guidance, almost half of the youngest Futurewealthy also acknowledge that they currently do not have the tools they need or the information they need to make informed decisions, while only one-fourth of their older counterparts feel the same. ""It is clear that the value the new generation of Futurewealthy is receiving from their advisors has a significant impact on their engagement with a firm,"" said Kevin Crowe, Head of Solutions, SEI Advisor Network. ""As advisors adapt to new generations of Futurewealthy, they will need to offer more flexibility in how they deliver value, as clients are now seeking to refine how they pay for advisory services going forward and redefine how they value those services."" This paper is the fourth and final paper in a four-part series delving into the findings of The Futurewealth Report 2015, which maps the journey of the world's up-and-coming wealthy with their wealth manager. The first report examined the core functions of the relationship manager, while the second report examined the importance of the relationship manager. The third report uncovered the divide between generations with regard to wealth management, and outlined the industry evolution needed to support the youngest Futurewealthy.

392;Risk-parity mutual funds have been touted as a way to build diversified portfolios that equalize the risks investors take in asset classes such as stocks, bonds and commodities. But lately, a depressed commodities market and an untiring bull market in stocks are bringing down those mutual funds, writes WSJ.com’s Wealth Adviser. “It’s been a tough period,” says Robert Schoen, co-head of global asset allocation at Putnam Investments, whose $196 million Putnam Dynamic Risk Allocation fund has shed 2% this year through Nov. 5, according to Morningstar. “It hasn’t been a great period for a well-diversified portfolio.” A group of 11 risk-parity funds lost 3.6% on average this year through Nov. 5, while a blended strategy consisting of 60% in the MSCI World Index and 40% in the Barclays BCS +0.92% Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index gained 1.4% over the same period. The performance is testing investors’ patience. In the nine months through September, they pulled about $699 million from the risk-parity funds Morningstar tracks. “When you have energy and commodities doing as poorly as they have, that’s one of the three legs of the stool that hasn’t been doing well,” says Josh Charlson, director of manager research for alternative strategies at Morningstar.PLANNING & INVESTING:Well-regarded funds in a 401(k) can still be burdened by high fees. Many mutual funds have multiple share classes with very different fee structures, notes a story in The Wall Street Journal’s monthly Investing in Funds & ETFs report. So even if a 401(k) plan offers otherwise solid funds, it may be offering investment options loaded with fees. For instance, a John Hancock target-date fund for people aiming to retire around 2025 has six share classes for retirement-plan use with annual expenses ranging from 0.64% of assets to 1.39%, the Journal says. Over time, higher fees can take a big bite out of investors’ returns.THE BUSINESS: MetLife MET -1.72% warns of ‘significant fine’ for variable-annuity sales. MetLife Inc. warned in a regulatory filing that it may face a “significant fine” for alleged problems surrounding its sale of retirement-income products, writes The Wall Street Journal. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority notified MetLife on Sept. 25 that it would recommend disciplinary action against the insurer’s MetLife Securities Inc. broker-dealer. The possible penalty would cover “potential violations of Finra rules regarding alleged misrepresentations, suitability, and supervision in connection with sales and replacements” of variable annuities, according to the filing. MetLife, which sold $6.35 billion of variable annuities last year, said in the filing that it is cooperating with the Finra investigation. But it said in a separate statement that it “strongly disagreed” with Finra’s conclusions and would defend itself.Bank of America BAC -1.53% moves closer to launching a robo. Bank of America Corp. has put dozens of employees to work on an automated investment offering for its Merrill Edge business, writes Bloomberg. The bank plans to launch the robo platform next year. Merrill Edge is Bank of America’s wealth-management offering for mass affluent investors. It serves clients online, through hundreds of Bank of America branches in the U.S., as well as through centralized call centers. The move isn’t a surprise. Merrill Edge head Aron Levine told The Wall Street Journal in May that the bank was “actively looking” at a robo offering and was weighing when to launch it. Mr. Levine said then the offering wouldn’t replace any of the bank’s existing services or advisers. Stifel lowers its estimate of Barclays brokers to join.  Stifel Financial Corp. says it expects 95 to 105 of Barclays PLC’s U.S. wealth-management advisers to join, compared to the 180 it originally looked to grab, writes OnWallStreet. Stifel agreed in June to acquire Barclays’s U.S. wealth-management unit. But since then, a number of advisers have turned down deals to join Stifel, opting for offers made by Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley MS -0.85% and others. Recruiters told the publication that Stifel wasn’t a good fit for many of the Barclays advisers. “If you went to work for Barclays, do you want to work for Stifel? A lot of the Barclays guys were legacy Lehman. Did that seem like an uptick? And then there are other folks who used this to get a better offer. These were two really different firms,” said industry recruiter Bill Willis.Financial Engines FNGN -0.86% to buy Mutual Fund Store. Financial Engines Inc. will broaden its reach among 401(k) participants through its roughly $560 million acquisition of The Mutual Fund Store, writes The Wall Street Journal. The deal will give Financial Engines’s clients access to The Mutual Fund Store’s 125 locations. “This acquisition advances our vision to provide independent advisory services to more people and we believe will also fuel significant future growth,” Financial Engines said in a statement. Financial Engines said in September it would begin offering millions of 401(k) plan savers access to its human advisers and online tools in order to appeal to plan sponsors seeking to add so-called financial wellness offerings.THE PRACTICE:Improving diversity through recruitment. As more minorities graduate from college and move into the middle class, the need for financial planners who are minorities will rise. Right now, the number of financial planners who are minorities is low, Kevin Matthews II tells WSJ.com’s Wealth Adviser. But there is an opportunity for firms to capture this growing market by hiring planners who authentically reflect clients’ diverse communities by creating a diversity recruitment strategy. Instead of just going on a hiring spree, Mr. Matthews suggests examining the surrounding community to learn more about the demographics and how they are projected to change in the future. Mr. Matthews says firms should create robust training programs to help candidates enter the industry. Such an effort may require capital, but Mr. Matthews says it should be viewed as an investment in the firm’s future.;Wealth Management;http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/11/09/wealth-adviser-daily-briefing-risk-parity-funds-getting-dragged-down/
393;"The practice of private wealth management continues to change as quickly as it grows. For insight on key business trends that will influence wealth management over the next three to five years, CFA Institute Magazine invited three experts to share their views in a roundtable discussion: Stephen Horan, CFA, CIPM, managing director of credentialing at CFA Institute; Mark Tibergien, CEO and managing director at Pershing Advisor Solutions, LLC (a BNY Mellon company); and Scott Welch, chief investment officer at Dynasty Financial Partners. The following excerpts were taken from the participants’ remarks. A subsequent column will discuss the impact of technology trends.The Impact of Women and MillennialsStephen Horan (CFA Institute): One thing that I think is getting some more recognition but is largely unnoticed is the increasing significance of women as clientele. Right now, women control about half of the wealth in the US, but they’re estimated to be in control of two-thirds of the wealth by 2020. That’s stunning. The reasons for that are they’re inheriting wealth, they’re entering the work force at a greater rate, and they have a greater longevity, so they hang on to that wealth and as a result have longer retirements. Women also tend to be better savers than men. So you’ve got this changing face of the investor base along the lines of gender, and I think any adviser would tell you advising a woman is very different from advising a man, which is different from advising a couple.We’ve spent so much time focusing on retirees and retirement needs that we’ve sort of taken our eye off the ball that there is an up-and-coming millennial investor base that is becoming increasingly significant in terms of numbers. It’s not so much about wealth yet, because they have yet to accumulate significant wealth, but they’re partly at the core of this robo-adviser movement. And what’s interesting about them (beyond their obvious penchant for digital solutions) is that they disintermediate investment planning. By that I mean you don’t really need an adviser to do all the things that they currently do; [investors] can interact more directly with financial markets.But millennials are also just very different types of investors; they are far more cautious and risk averse than prior generations. For example, they hold about half their savings in cash, compared with less than a quarter for all other age groups. They hold more than twice as much cash.What’s interesting about these things taken together is that we have an investor base that increasingly looks less and less like the adviser base, which is middle-aged men—and that perhaps could be generous on the age side [for the adviser base]. That’s going to continue to create challenges for advisers who are trying to serve clients who don’t share the same perspectives and life experiences, [who have a] penchant for digital solutions and things like that.Talent ShortageMark Tibergien (Pershing Advisor Solutions): There is an acute talent shortage facing all the financial services. Since 2008, there are 50,000 fewer financial professionals in all. I think the average age for principals is around 61, but the average age for all advisers is about 50. Only 10% of the adviser population is under the age of 35. In fact, the CFP Board [Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, Inc.] says they have more CFPs over the age of 70 than they do under the age of 30.Whatever you use as your data point, the face of the advisory business is gray and wrinkled, and that is a challenge because we as an industry have not done a good job of making this a compelling industry to work in. We [Pershing Advisor Solutions] asked our Millennial Advisory Board to casually inquire among their friends who are not in this business why they chose not to come into finance. There were three reasons cited: (1) I never studied it in high school and didn’t know it was a career choice; (2) everything I know about the industry is bad; it’s corrupt; it’s not a place that profoundly helps the lives of other people; and (3) it’s just a sales job, and I don’t want to be in sales. So, as a profession, we have a lot of work to do to demonstrate that it’s actually a helpful career; it’s not a sales job. If people are not learning personal economics in high school, that probably explains why people make a lot of bad financial decisions.Fluctuating Prices and MarginsMark Tibergien (Pershing Advisor Solutions): This is the only profession where clients pay for the value they bring rather than the value the professional brings—meaning that, the richer I am, the more that I pay. It’s kind of a classic Marxist sort of approach to pricing when you think about it. What’s happening is that firms do continue to charge basis points on assets, but in many cases, they’re also charging a retainer or a project fee for other services. But it’s not uncommon in the high-net-worth space to actually see a 5–10 basis-point increase in the asset management fee.There are six levers of profitability in a wealth management firm. Pricing is one of them and perhaps the most controllable, but the others relate to volume, meaning that many firms are not growing at a rate fast enough to keep up with withdrawals. Productivity is becoming a real issue, because [firms are] not managing workflow well, and that’s a function of capacity. Third, the service mix may not be well defined, and one reason it’s not well defined is because of the fourth lever, a poor client mix, where the firms don’t have enough clients within their sweet spot. The fifth lever relates to cost control. Finally, bull markets camouflage a lot of sins, and in some respects, we’ve seen this persistent growth in the equity markets, which has allowed for creeper costs to come into a number of advisory firms. If you look at those six levers [pricing, productivity, service mix, client mix, cost control, and creeper costs], you have to say it isn’t just pricing that determines my margins; it’s “How do I manage the rest of the ship in order to produce an optimal bottom line?”Evolving Investment ManagementScott Welch (Dynasty Financial Partners): One trend on the investment side is the democratization of the investment solution set that’s available to clients. A second is simply what I call the “race to zero” in terms of active asset management fees.One aspect of the democratization trend is the explosion in the number of liquid alternatives, or alternative investment mutual funds, that are now available. Both the quantity and quality of those strategies continue to improve, and that will make accessible to a wider audience of investors the kinds of strategies that historically have only been available to qualified purchasers or accredited investors.This is not to suggest, by the way, that hedge funds or LPs (limited partnerships) are doomed for the graveyard. I think the good ones will continue to thrive and prosper. But the door is now open to a much wider set of investors to build far more diversified and sophisticated portfolios beyond simply stocks and bonds.A second trend is the explosion of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), so-called factor-based ETFs, and other low-cost structures now available to investors. I don’t like the phrase “smart beta,” but that is the industry shorthand for factor-based ETFs.As a simple example, Eaton Vance got approval not too long ago for a new kind of structure called an ETMF (exchange-traded mutual fund), which is an actively managed ETF. It has the daily liquidity of an ETF, but the fund company doesn’t have to disclose the underlying positions within that ETF on a daily basis like it does with a traditional ETF. Its disclosure is based more on the mutual fund standard of every six months, which will allow that ETF provider to more actively manage the strategy without daily transparency into it. I don’t know if it will be a good product or a bad product, but I do know it will work to drive down the price of active management.When you combine all the different lower-cost investment products that have and will continue to come out, I think it’s undeniable that there will be a deep impact on active managers. Premium managers will always be able to charge a premium price, but many active managers are going to have to change the way that they manage their books in order to justify their higher fees. That’s why I refer to this trend as the race to zero, and it’s happening both at the product level and at the advisory level because of digital platforms.I think we will see a similar impact in the LP and hedge fund space in the sense that the truly brilliant investors will survive and thrive, and they’ll continue to be able to charge premium prices for premium performance. Clients will still be willing to give up liquidity and pay a higher fee in order to get access to that performance. So, I suspect that “star managers” and things like private equity and other illiquid investments will continue to be very popular. But these pricing pressures pose a distinct competitive threat for the folks who aren’t premium providers.The bottom line from an investment perspective is that an end investor now can build a very sophisticated, very globally diversified portfolio at a far lower cost and with far better liquidity terms than that same client could have built even five years ago. Asset managers and wealth managers are going to have to respond to all of these trends. In an era of commoditization of services, they will need a differentiated business model and clear articulation of their value proposition to justify their higher fees. And in the wake of downward pricing pressure, they will need to focus on core competencies and increase their use of outsourcing to drive profitability.";Wealth Management;https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2015/10/05/what-trends-are-influencing-the-future-of-wealth-management/

395;"Squirrel Money, the peer-to-peer lender owned by former Australia & New Zealand Banking Group executive John Bolton, has opened for business, taking a swipe at 'inauthentic, bank-owned rivals'.Squirrel, which gained its Financial Markets Authority licence in August, offers secured and unsecured personal loans of between $3,000 and $70,000. Managing director and owner Bolton said it was the first ""authentic"" peer-to-peer lending service in New Zealand because it didn't source its funds from banks.""Other offerings are really just marketing campaigns for the very banks weíre disrupting,"" Bolton said. ""Squirrel Money is about connecting borrowers with real lenders, not banks or finance houses.""Squirrel is the second P2P lender in the New Zealand market after Harmoney Corp launched in September 2014 with $100 million in funding from Heartland Bank and New York-based Blue Elephant Capital Management. Harmoney has attracted investors including auction site operator Trade Me, which paid $7.7 million for a 15 percent stake, and the UK's P2P Global Investments, which owns 4.7 percent and provided a $200 million funding line.P2P Global's investment valued Harmoney at $100 million. The business has gained more than 3,000 active lenders in its first year, with an average individual account balance of $6,000, and between 7,000 and 8,000 borrowers.      Bolton says Squirrel wants to draw investors away from banks by marketing itself as a safe option for investors who want a higher return than they can get from a term deposit, but don't want the risk of investing in the stock market. Investors will be able to choose an interest rate of between 6 percent and 12 percent, although rates had to be set where they would attract borrowers. By contrast, a two-year term deposit is paying annual interest of 3.71 percent.Bolton told BusinessDesk that investors who chose a lower interest rate would have their money lent out more quickly, as that would be the ""hottest money on the market"", and he anticipated returns settling at around 7-to-8 percent. As a protection mechanism for investors, Squirrel charges borrowers a ""variable risk premium"" based on their credit rating, and has established a reserve fund, topped up by fees from borrowers, to cover any missed payments or defaults. The reserve fund meant investors wouldn't have to be as concerned with the underlying credit risk. The fund will be set at 4 percent of loan balances, which would exceed the estimated credit losses of 1.5 percent.Interest rates for Squirrel borrowers are determined by an auction bidding process. All borrowers are credit checked and assigned a credit score. Bolton estimates borrowing rates at between 9 and 12 percent, with the potential for borrowers with high credit scores to pay less depending on investor demand.Bolton said Squirrel isn't targeting borrowers with a poor credit record who would otherwise go to a finance company, but rather borrowers with good credit ratings who would benefit from his firm's lower borrowing costs and an application process he says is easier than for a bank loan.Bolton has also set up Squirrel's parent company Squirrel Mortgages, which claims to be Auckland's largest mortgage broker, writing over $800 million of home loans a year.";social economy;http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/BU1511/S00046/squirrel-launches-p2p-lending-site-taking-swipe-at-rivals.htm
396;Chinaís internet finance industry continues to grow dramatically, but this rapid growth has been paired with a high number of dodgy p2p platforms and failures.  According to a report published in QZ, research completed by Morgan Stanley and Wangdaizhijia states that since 2007, 370 peer to peer lending platforms have failed.  The majority, 270, failed in the last year.Understandably the number of financial crimes have surged as well.In the first half of 2015, 10,608 individuals were arrested for suspected financial fraud ñ up 67.2% versus the year prior. The report by China News states that 11,276 people associated with over 800o different cases were charged during the first 6 months of 2015.These numbers are not for P2P lending fraud only as the internet has made it easier to commit all sorts of financial fraud, but the report stated thatìCriminals are exploiting the anonymity afforded by P2P lending platforms to commit financial crimes,î according to Nie Jianhua, deputy director of Supreme Peopleís Procuratorate public prosecution department.The Chinese P2P lending sector is the largest in the world.  According to a report earlier this month, P2P lending transactions topped $18 billion in the month of September alone.Chinese regulators are in the process of creating stricter rules for online lending. This will be to the benefit of larger, more established firms, but a shakeout is on the horizon with many platforms expected to disappear as they will be unable to abide by new regulations.;social economy;http://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2015/10/76259-report-270-p2p-lending-companies-failed-in-china-last-year/
397;Peer-to-peer, or marketplace, lenders have been growing fast as they seek to disrupt the traditional world of banking by connecting borrowers directly with lenders. As they develop, however, theyíre bumping against a host of old and new rules, including a recent court decision that could make it more difficult for them to lend. Theyíre also becoming more firmly entrenched with the banks they had once set out to circumvent.Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of the Treasury asked for more information about the swiftly expanding industry.On Thursday, Counselor to the Secretary Antonio Weiss said at a marketplace lending conference in New York that his department is still analyzing the comments received. ìTreasury will continue to monitor developments in this important and rapidly evolving marketplace,î he said. ìOur guiding principle will remain to seek the broadest possible access to safe, affordable, and sustainable credit.îHereís what caught our eye in the more than 100 responses received by the Treasury Department.The American Bankers Association and the Consumer Bankers Association made the point that ìP2Pî lenders face less of a regulatory burden than the banks theyíre arguably competing with:Banks are subject to stringent and regular examination by state and federal agencies who proactively address concerns before an issue arises that could impact consumers. Currently alternative lenders have little regulatory oversight and typically only see examinations in response to consumer complaints. Consumer protections mean little unless there is oversight to ensure that they are being applied fairly, uniformly, and consistently.The Milken Institute, meanwhile, argued the sector shouldnít face harsh regulation just because itís new:Because marketplace lending is such a rapidly innovating field, regulators should avoid overly prescriptive regulation that favors or requires particular models. Rather, regulators should favor principles based regulation that focuses on an end result of transparency and protection while allowing market forces and consumer choice to drive specific implementations.Milken also had some thoughts on the recent court ruling, known as Madden v. Midland Funding. The ruling may restrict marketplace lenders from bypassing state usury laws by joining with banks in states where there are no such rules:While failure to address the problem raised by Madden would probably not kill marketplace lending, it might force lenders and their partners to create new and more complex structures that, while technically compliant, were even less related to the economic reality of the transaction and instantly subject to litigation. Lenders could also pursue state licenses, but this would be costly, time consuming, and potentially difficult for new entrants relative to the bank-partnership option. A legislative fix would quickly provide needed clarity and consistency to the market.The Structured Finance Industry Group (SFIG) thought new regulations could stifle the nascent sector:While we expect industry standards to continue to evolve for this market, we firmly believe that for the various asset classes involved there are comprehensive sets of regulation and industry standards already in place. We strongly caution that any attempt to create new regulations targeted solely at this market may, in fact, have the undesirable result of stifling innovation and growth, potentially limiting access to and availability of credit for consumers and small businesses.CommonBond, a marketplace lender that specializes in student loans, argued peer-to-peer lenders should have access to the Federal Reserveís discount window, which offers funding for banks:Traditional banks have a large advantage in cost of funds over marketplace lenders. Ranging from low-cost consumer deposits to accessing the Fed window, these banks have an outside advantage when it comes to lending capital. The federal government can take steps to address this inequality by creating a level playing field for marketplace lenders. First, the government can encourage institutional investors to invest in marketplace lending by simplifying investment rules. Second, they can offer a lending window to marketplace lenders similar to traditional banks (e.g., access to a low-cost government credit facility for responsible lenders).Lending Club, the worldís biggest marketplace lender, has a laundry list of requests, including access to government data and some tax breaks for the notes it sells to investors:The federal government could create significant benefits for borrowers by improving borrowersí ability to share government-held data with lenders with the express consent of the borrower, by creating incentives in the tax code to increase economic growth in underserved communities and promote savings, and by simplifying the tax reporting and statement delivery for investments in marketplace loans. ÖWe propose that the IRSís tax treatment of the losses match the treatment of income from marketplace lending. Further, given the attractive returns profile for these investments, the Treasury could encourage savings for investors, particularly in retirement accounts, by reducing or eliminating the tax burden on small dollar investments up to $5,000.When it comes to the securitization of P2P loans, investors like Blue Elephant generally resisted the notion that marketplace lenders should have to keep a piece of the deals sold to investors:We do not believe that ìskin in the gameî models are superior to models where loans are sold in their entirety. Unlike banks that have sticky capital in the form of deposits, marketplace lenders are reliant on a broad spectrum of investors to raise their capital. This is their ìskinîóif they lose support of their investor base, they effectively fail to function as a business. Forcing a platform to hold loans will not necessarily make them a better lender.;social economy;http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-29/people-have-some-interesting-thoughts-about-peer-to-peer-lending

399;"The Securities Commission (SC) will introduce a framework for peer-to-peer (P2P) lending next year.This is in line with the growing interest in the development of this area. Notably, P2P lending has grown significantly in other big markets like the United States, China, the United Kingdom and India. As P2P lending platform providers borrow and lend money, they are required to adhere to minimum expectations set out by the regulators. Through these platforms, a lender can earn interest by lending to borrowers based on their risk appetite. On the other hand, people who need money can borrow at a lower cost, compared with getting a loan from the bank. This is especially so when the borrower cannot show the banks their credit worthiness. At the same time, some of the loan amount by the borrowers can be too small for the banks to make sufficient profits. In this intricate business, it is the credit scoring that ìmakes or breaksî P2P lending. ìYou need to have the right matrix to determine the credit quality of the borrowers so that lenders can decide how much to lend,î said SC market development executive director Goh Ching Yin. Some of the ways used to determine borrowersí credit rating include big data, the borrowerís behaviour on social media and other digital footprints. Such activities are made possible because of technology, marking the emergence of financial technology or better known as fintech. Besides P2P lending, equity crowdfunding and mobile payment are other forms of financial activities that come under the big umbrella of fintech. Understanding its tremendous potential, the SC has started the initiative, known as afFINity@SC, to catalyse the growth of the sector, as well as to provide policy and regulatory clarity on new fintech areas to promote responsible financial innovation. More importantly, fintech will encourage more innovation in the financial services industry, which includes the capital market space. The SC will work with other relevant stakeholders, including innovators, investors and other authorities, to push the sector forward. It will be done by:> Creating awareness and catalysing innovative fintech solutions; > Forming clusters to organise and nurture a wider fintech ecosystem; and> Providing policy and regulatory clarity that is conducive for innovation. ìIt is important for innovators to let the regulator know the products and services they plan to offer before deployment in a traditionally regulated sector like financial services,î Goh added. The regulatory body will organise all queries and expressions of interest received into various clusters, which form across different groups of stakeholders. Once interest in a specific cluster gains considerable traction, afFINity@SC may convene a focus group to discuss and collaborate towards introducing technology-driven innovations and solutions.";social economy;http://www.thestar.com.my/Business/Business-News/2015/10/29/SC-to-unveil-P2P-lending-framework-next-year/?style=biz
400;Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending was started with the idea of connecting individual borrowers with individual lenders, but of late many variations of P2P lending has become popular. Business lending and in particle loans for Small and Medium Enterprises now forms a sizeable bulk. Popularity is, however, not without its reason.More likely to understand your needs - P2P lending works in a manner that is very different from traditional financial institutions. An SME looking for a loan from a bank has only that many banks and financial institutions to tap. On the other hand, in P2P borrowing and SME has to merely place his requirement and thousands of individual lenders gets to view and decide on your requirements. If you have a good credit rating, the chances are you will get multiple proposals to fund your requirement, in a reverse auction style. It is then left to the SME to choose the best deal, the chances of which are multiplied because of the  scores of individual lenders.;social economy;http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/money/five-reasons-why-p2p-lending-is-ideal-for-small-businesses/articleshow/49284976.cms

402;TrustBuddy: A Brief Company History So FarBitcoinist_TrustBuddy ABTrustBuddy is a well-established peer-to-peer lending provider, offering their services to consumers, small and mid-size businesses. Over the years, Trustbuddy has expanded its services from just Sweden to other European countries, including Spain, Poland and The Netherlands. All of the company business has been conducted in an online manner ever since TrustBuddy was founded in 2009.The year 2014 was pretty good for TrustBuddy, as the company managed to merge and acquire two different companies. As part of their expansion to The Netherlands, the company merged with Geldvoorelkaar.nl, an online platform with a similar business model. A month later, TrustBuddy acquired AGATA Spa, which was part of the companyís expansion to Spain. Putting that success aside for a moment, things started to go haywire in September of 2015, when internal executive changes were announced. Three individuals joined the management team on September 7. All of these individuals came from the Klama company, where they filled a variety of roles. Such a vast array of talented individuals could only be beneficial to TrustBuddy as a whole. But it seems as if these executive changes were the first sign of things to come. On the same day these three new individuals officially became a part of TrustBuddy AB, former Chief Technology Officer Marius Gabrielsen decided to leave the company to ìpursue new challengesî. Furthermore, the company Chief Information Officer stepped down and left the company on September 4, 2015.John Ward, one of the newly appointed chief executives on September 7, was promoted to acting CFO on September 17. Former CFO Linus Lˆnnroth, all of a sudden, decided to leave the company ìin pursuit of other career opportunitiesî. Oneís person demise is another personís rise in standing, especially in this dog-eat-dog world. TrustBuddy AB Investigates Financial MisconductBitcoinist_TrustBuddy Internal InvestigationA few days ago, things took a turn for the worse, as the newly instated TrustBuddy AB management is investigating internal misconduct by former executives. Several breaches of both internal and external regulations have been pointed out so far, and the investigation is still ongoing at the time of publication. Among the list of regulation, breaches are topics such as using lendersí capital without their permission, creating a discrepancy between the funds owed to lenders and the available balance. Additionally, the reassignment of existing loans is not helping matters much either. Last but not last, there is 37M SEK issued in loans, which has not been assigned to any lenders. Due to this ongoing internal investigation, the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority ñ Finansinspektionen ñ has ordered TrustBuddy AB to suspend their services until further notice. For platform users, this means that either deposits or withdrawals are available right now, effectively freezing customer funds for an undisclosed amount of time. Former company executives who are still on the TrustBuddy AB payroll, have been suspended for as long as the investigation takes place. All current and former employees participating as lenders on the TrustBuddy platform have seen their accounts being put on hold. Simon Nathanson, TrustBuddy AB Chairman of the Board, stated:ìWe are of course very disappointed in the situation that has arisen. With the new management team in place, TrustBuddy had both the platform and the capacity to create a company built for growth and industry leadership. In light of the recent events, we now have to redirect our focus to find a solution that is in the best interest for all stakeholders.î FinTech Innovation Does Not Make Humans IncorruptibleBitcoinist_TrustBuddy AB InfographicEarly reports indicate this breaching of regulations has been present ever since TrustBuddy AB was founded.

403;For investors, P2P lending has quickly grown from a fringe asset class to a popular alternative to traditional fixed income securities. Focused on various types of loans such as for small businesses, student loans or do it yourself home improvement projects, with the P2P lending platform, private investors lend directly to borrowers. As electronic marketplaces, many platforms are able to provide lending terms to borrowers that are below those they can source from banks. In addition, due to record low interest rates around the globe, investors are seeing higher returns than those of traditional fixed income products.The growth in P2P lending has led to a growing market and increased competition for new borrowers and investors. As a result, many lending platform operators are looking towards partnerships to assist in customer referrals. Examples of partnerships include deals with accounting and software firms that deal with small and medium businesses, cooperation with websites that serve the home improvement sector, and personal finance app developers.Adding to the list of partnerships is a deal announced today between GMO Click Securities and P2P lender Maneo. Both based in Japan and serving the local market, Maneo operates a P2P lending platform, which according to the firm has been used to raise •34 billion (@$283 million) in loans since its founding in 2007.Partnering together, GMO and Maneo plan to work together to increase P2P lending as an investment product for retail investors. As part of the deal, GMO Click is expected to introduce P2P investing to its customers and act as a source of leads to Maneo.In addition to acting as a customer referral source which is similar to other partnerships closed by P2P lenders, GMO Click and Maneo are also expected to collaborate on several operating initiatives. Among them include creating liquidity pools of lending capital, developing new markets to offer loan services for, including mezzanine loans, and having ongoing business development discussions of the P2P lending industry.Beyond being another P2P lending partnership, the deal is noteworthy as it involves a brokerage firm. Despite what could be considered overlapping customer bases, as of yet, there has been very little cooperation between investment brokers and P2P lenders or equity crowdfunding platforms.;social economy;http://www.financemagnates.com/fintech/p2p/gmo-click-enters-p2p-lending-with-maneo-partnership/
404;Peer-to-peer lending (P2P) has experienced astonishing growth in the UK since its inception a decade ago, but it is only over the last eighteen months that it has changed course from 'alternative' to mainstream. The previously constraints of choosing between putting your money into low-risk, low-return options such as bonds (or even just straightforward bank savings accounts) and negotiating the often volatile stocks and shares market are no more.By lending money directly to real people seeking a loan, both lender and borrower reap the benefit of a streamlined, online matching process. For the latter, this translates into a personal loan at a competitive APR, while the lender will enjoy returns typically in excess of 5 per cent. Compared with the derisory rates currently being offered by banks on savings accounts, the clamour which has seen the P2P industry breach the £3 billion mark comes as little surprise.This number is expected to swell to £50 billion by 2017 too with the launch of a new Innovative Finance ISA (IFISA), of which P2P is recognised as the premier component. IFISA, which goes live in April 2016, represents a huge coup for our sector, and is an important acknowledgement of the uniqueness of peer-to-peer as an asset class.Given our differing risk profile to banks - lender capital is not covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme - the existing Cash ISA would have been an inappropriate wrapper for P2P to be shoehorned into. Yet, given the dependable returns the P2P sector has provided lenders over a tumultuous period for the rest of the UK's financial services sector, the existing Stocks & Shares ISA would hardly have been a good fit either.Despite the lack of FSCS cover, most platforms have measures in place to minimise the risk of capital loss. A lender's money is normally diversified over multiple loans, while reserve funds to compensate for any arrears and defaults on borrower repayments are commonplace.Consumer confidence is the very lifeblood of our sector, and it is why we take such measures to ensure those who invest their hard-earned money with us can rest easy at night. As such, every platform worth its salt in the UK stands united in their embrace of regulation.The big breakthrough on this front for peer-to-peer lending has been that of incoming FCA regulation. Platforms have been allowed to operate under interim permissions since April 2014, but the application deadline of 31 October for full FCA authorisation is a defining one. Over 100 companies have already applied, and any industry which experiences exponential growth (around £1.3 billion in loans were originated in the UK in 2014, versus £480 million in 2013) will attract its share of opportunists and upstarts.However, the rigorous - and expensive - demands laid out by the FCA regulatory framework will wean out those platforms not fit for purpose, leaving behind only the most credible who have proven their worth as a sound investment option for lenders.The collective view among us all is that we want to create an enduring service which presents a sustained challenge to the inefficiencies and poor risk-reward value that has dogged financial services in the past. Regulation will be key in achieving this, and, most importantly, will give lenders reaffirmation that they are justified in their investment choice.We would never advocate piling all of one's money into any single platform, or in peer-to-peer lending as a whole, becausediversification is at the heart of sensible investing. But for those looking to do more with their portfolios, P2P is becoming a viable and lucrative candidate for a slice of the pie.We're often referred to as alternative, or as 'disrupters'. And yes, such terms carry a modicum of truth to them, given the size of the high-street establishment we're up against. But our outlook is that we're actually delivering a simplified service where the value and benefit is absorbed by the consumer, not a series of profit-hungry intermediaries. If that's disruptive, then our question is... How on earth has the status quo persisted this long?;social economy;http://www.spearswms.com/blog/why-peer-to-peer-lending-is-about-to-become-the-next-big-thing/#.VjdHl4eFPIV

408;While the rise of Sipps has been widely documented, the growth in the peer-to-peer market is yet to attract the same level of attention. This is unlikely to remain the case for long, with experts predicting it will double in size every six months.With such impressive growth, it is interesting the touch points between the two markets have so far been limited. Why is this?There are two main points of concern. The first is the perception the P2P market is still immature, implying the risk of losses is too high. The second is that HM Revenue & Customs rules mean loans could lead to tax charges on the Sipp member, which providers cannot prevent.Perception of the marketís maturity needs to be reassessed given the pace of growth. The three largest players each have between 20,000 and 60,000 lenders on-platform. The largest recently broke through the £1bn barrier in funds lent. Meanwhile, it has been subject to FCA regulation since April 2014 and appears to have welcomed it well. The same cannot be said of parts of the Sipp industry at times. P2P lending has also attracted an impressive level of Government support, with millions of pounds injected into it by the British Business Bank and the proposed launch of Innovative Finance Isas.Risk of failureAnother concern has been the possibility of platform failure. Indeed, a few have hit problems. In the last few weeks, problems with TrustBuddy, one of the smaller platforms, have highlighted the importance of the issue. The biggest previous failure was YesSecure, although lenders reportedly received funds back. In late 2014 GraduRates closed but one of the big-three platforms, RateSetter, took over. The only failure known to have resulted in the loss of funds was Quakle in 2011. All of the issues have arisen with the smallest platforms but the Sipp market itself has not been immune to provider failure.Most P2P platforms now offer protection from the risk of loss for individual borrowers. A common option is a protection fund, typically funded by a fee from each borrower. The biggest is now around £20m.You would expect HMRCís rules on pension scheme lending to be the source of less debate. But even here there has been uncertainty. The key considerations are whether there is a connection between the lender and borrower, and whether the loan is used by the borrower to purchase taxable property.If the Sipp lends money to a person connected with a member or ex-member of the pension scheme, an unauthorised payment occurs. The test is not applied at individual Sipp arrangement level but at the level of the registered pension scheme sitting above the arrangement. It might be easy to check whether a borrower is connected to the Sipp member but it is less straightforward when the test is applied to all, say, 80,000 members of the same scheme or anyone connected to them.The solution may come from the way P2P platforms structure their loans. While some offer direct lending between individuals and borrowers, the bigger platforms tend towards a pooled, anonymised model. Funds can be spread across dozens, with neither the lender nor borrower knowing who is involved in the transaction. Some platforms also require clients to self-certify they will not intentionally lend to, or borrow from, connected parties and have processes to highlight any chance of collusion.The question is whether this will satisfy HMRC. Using its definition of connection, it is impossible for the party on either side of a P2P transaction to know whether the other is connected. Would this be sufficient to demonstrate an absence of collusion, or would Sipp providers be expected to prove this beyond all doubt? If the latter, the position becomes unworkable on any sort of scale. It is hoped that HMRC comes to a sensible conclusion.Taxable propertyThe use of loan funds to purchase taxable property has also been misunderstood. If a Sipp lends money to someone and the funds are used to purchase taxable property, HMRC says it can have an interest in that property. This is a problem regardless of whether the lender and borrower are connected and whether the loan is secured or unsecured.Again, the solution may come from the platformís model. If the loan is directly between a single lender and borrower, and funds are used to purchase taxable property, the Sipp member is likely to have inadvertently incurred an unauthorised payment charge. However, where lending is pooled, the Sipp may be treated as having an insufficiently significant interest in the taxable property for a tax charge to apply. Again, It comes back to how HMRC views this.Although the lending is pooled, an individual contractual relationship is likely to exist between lender and borrower for their part of the overall transaction. If HMRC applies the ëlevel of interestí test at the combined amount of funds borrowed, individual Sipps may not have an issue. If the test is applied at the level of the individual contractual relationship between Sipp and borrower, there is a problem.Discussions are ongoing between P2P lenders, Sipp operators and HMRC to resolve the technical issues. It will be a shame if the Governmentís own rules, introduced a decade ago when P2P was not a consideration, prevent greater collaboration in todayís financial landscape.;social economy;https://www.moneymarketing.co.uk/technical-issues-what-is-holding-back-p2p-lending-in-sipps/
409;Financial services technology company Fiserv has published research on the UK alternative finance market that indicates new finance will top £10 billion by 2020.According to the report, UK SMEs will benefit dramatically from the growth of peer to peer lending and crowdfunding over the next five years. The report entitled, ìFuture Trends in UK Bankingî, commissioned by Fiserv, notes that SMEs generate approximately 43% of all private sector revenue in the UK yet access to credit remains a problematic challenge.Fiserv correctly highlights that following the financial crisis government officials recognized that traditional banking was not up to the task.  The UK government has since pushed forward policy initiatives to boost access to capital, and these programs and regulations are starting to pay off. The report estimates P2B lending to be worth £850 million in new flows of credit in 2014 (and £1.2 billion in total). This is a dramatic increase from just £20 million in 2011. The crowdfunding market was estimated to be worth £310 million in 2013. Fiserv asserts that these sources of new finance could be worth £12.3 billion a year by 2020, which would represent a £14,000 loan for every small business applying for credit. A challenge persists, though, as many SMEs (58%) are not aware of alternatives to traditional finance such as commercial banks. Fiserv believes this is not necessarily to the detriment of banks. As the economy 10£ Queen Elizabeth British Poundsexpands, demand for credit will increase thus improving the bottom line of traditional banks as well.ìOur research suggests that improved and user-friendly technology is impelling the growth of alternative finance in the U.K. We have seen the P2B and crowdfunding sectors engaging in a concerted marketing push, which is likely to raise awareness significantly. The buzz around alternative finance for SMEs is giving alternative financiers legitimacy and encouraging SMEs to try these alternative funding options,î stated Travers Clarke-Walker of Fiserv.Fiserv sees a compelling opportunity for traditional banks to innovate and adapt. Either by partnering with younger, more creative firms or by creating their own new products.  The real question is will old finance let culture and ossified processes inhibit change. Time will tell.;social economy;http://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2015/10/75285-research-new-finance-including-p2p-lending-crowdfunding-to-top-10-billion-by-2020/
410;"Fintech is super-hot these days.  Finance is having its newspaper moment where all aspects of the industry are moving online.  The disruptive shift is global too as change is taking place in the Americas, Asia and across Europe. The UK is in many ways the epicenter of this emblematic change.  Peer to peer (marketplace) lending claims its roots in Zopa ñ the largest of the online lenders in the UK. The rapid innovation has been aided by a government that is supportive of entrepreneurs and regulators dedicated to fostering competition.  But is P2P lending becoming a bit of a bubble?According to a recent report in BI, the boom is ìreminiscent of the dotcom bubbleî. The author spoke to LendInvest CEO and founder Christian Faes, who operates a P2P platform dedicated to short term mortgages.  According to Faes;ìWe think thereís growing skepticism about the whole fintech space and particularly peer-to-peer about whether these businesses can ever actually be profitable.îChristian FaesìI think the skepticism is right. Thereís a lot of businesses that have raised a lot of money over the last few years at seemingly crazy valuations and some of them donít appear to have any prospect of making any money at least in the next 5 years.îìUnderstandably people in the City start to scratch their heads and wonder what the hell is going on and think itís a bit reminiscent of the dotcom bubble. ìFaes states they are not ìfueled by giddy VC money to keep the lights onî casting shade towards operations that are not making a profit. LendInvest, notably, recently announced its second year of generating net income.The UK is regulated quite differently than in the US.  If you want to set up a platform that allows non-accredited investors in the States, you must subject yourself to a raft of regulations and work with a bank.  In the UK, the barriers are far lower but this is starting to change.  It appears the FCA is putting the brakes on a bit as it was recently reported that out of 114 applications to operate as a P2P Lender 30 have been partially, or completely, withdrawn.  The consultancy who created the report stated;ìThe high number of withdrawals suggests that the FCA is setting the bar high when it comes to full authorisation for P2P lenders- the process appears to be much tougher and more costly than many firms first anticipated.îThe online lending industry has benefited by the leadership and advocacy of the UK Peer-to-Peer Finance Association (P2PFA). The association represents ìover 90%î of the P2P lending market. The P2PFA has set a high bar of best practices and transparency, recognizing the importance of engendering a lending industry that protects both consumers and investors. You may view the list of members here.In a relatively new and fast-growing industry, it is inevitable there will be bumps along the way. Regulators walk a fine line of allowing an industry to grow while encouraging rational growth. Eventually, things will slow, and P2P lending will become the norm ñ not the exception.  Prior to this occurrence, there will be a period of consolidation as smaller, less competitive platforms are acquired or simply move on.  Louise Beaumont recently told Crowdfund Insider the industry embraces a ìstrong regulatory frameworkî ñ something most all industry participants echo.louise-beaumontìA strict and enforced regulatory regime will lead to consolidation and rationalisation of what is currently a fragmented marketplace. This should be welcomed as it will ensure that the best business models and most professionally run, compliant organisations are able to succeed.îSo is P2P reminiscent of the DotCom bubble? Having lived through it as both an observer and investor I believe it is not.  The DotCom bubble was fueled by ìirrational exuberanceî driven by overly enthusiastic IPOs by firms with a catchy name and virtually no revenues at all. The leaders in the P2P space are generating significant revenue ñ even if none of it is dropping to the bottom line (yet). Sure there is plenty of excitement in the sector ñ much of it merited and some not so much.

The peer-to-peer lender takes an unconventional approach to loan qualification, taking an applicantís academic credentials and work experience into account.Its loans are geared toward college students and young professionals, according to A Secure Life. The company is aimed at serving a demographic that will likely build strong credit but hasnít had the opportunity to do so yet. That said, to be eligible for a loan from Upstart, you must be employed or be starting a job within six months.Since it launched in May 2014, Upstart has distributed more than $190 million in loans. An Upstart loan has a three-year loan term. You can take out a loan for between $3,000 and $35,000. Depending on your credit score, you can receive your loan in as little as one business day.

After accepting a loan, you will receive funds in one to two business days.Peerform is a mature P2P site launched by Wall Street executives in 2010. Unlike other peer-to-peer lenders, Peerform allows you to take out loans for as little as $1,000. The maximum you can borrow is $25,000. Loan terms are for three years.Your APR depends on your credit score and range between 7.12 percent and 28.09 percent, which is lower than rates offered by many other lenders. A credit score of at least 600 is required, a minimum that is lower than other lending services. You also do not need to be employed in order to qualify if you can provide proof of another source of income.Additionally, if you loan is only partially funded, you can still accept the funds if at least $1,000 was raised. Note, however, that it can take up to 14 days for your loan to be funded and a few business days more for funds to be deposited into your account.5. CircleBack LendingCircleBack was launched in 2012 with a commitment to providing more varied personal loan types. You can receive loans to cover medical expenses, wedding costs, a vacation or relocation.You can take out loans for between $3,001 and $35,000 with a 3-year or 5-year term.

SoFiSoFi was founded in 2011 by a team of Stanford University business graduates. The peer-to-peer lender offers some of the lowest fees among competitors, in addition to no origination fee.SoFi has stricter eligibility requirements, however. You must have a degree from one of their selected accredited universities or graduate programs, for example. You must also have a strong employment background, credit score and consistent cash flow.The service also has a higher minimum loan amount. Your personal loan will be for between $5,000 and $100,000. If you qualify for student loan refinancing, you will need to take out, at minimum, $10,000.SoFi does, however, offer unemployment protection, and loans can be taken out with 3-, 5- and 7-year terms.

413;"Tragically, more than 78% of Indian population cannot get a personal loan from a bank or NBFC. Why? The reason is quite simple ñ most banks grant personal loans to salaried employees with annual gross salary above Rs. 3 Lakhs. Some banks give personal loans only to individuals earning Rs. 6 Lakhs per annum. If an individual is NOT working at one of the big MNCs or listed companies, then it would be a difficult for him to get a loan, or worse yet, his/her interest rate would be substantially higher. The P2P lending however, works differently; it comparatively uses multiple parameters to determine credit-worthiness of borrowers. The P2P credit models traverses beyond the salary of individuals; and fortunately, it does not decline the loan application even if the borrowerís salary is considerably low.P2P lending, peer-to-peer lending amongst individuals, is not a new concept. It has been practiced for centuries. Even today, most individuals ask money for their short-term needs from friends and relatives. In old days, most individuals did not make EMI payments when they got loans from their friends and relatives; most loans were interest free, and as a victim of the evil perception of temporary profitability and eventual losses, there was a balloon payment at the end of the loan period. The private money lenders charge high interest rates, and seize land or jewelry for collateral. The online P2P lending model formalized the entire process of taking loans from friends, relatives, and unknown individuals, and made it simpler for us to get quick cash or earn great returns. The borrower puts an online loan application, and the platform either rejects or accepts the same. If the loan application is approved, then the lenders fund the loan amount. The loan payment is collected in the form of EMI payments, and sent to lenders.Most loan underwriters believe that low salaried employees, less than 3 L per annum, would default, or delay their loan payments. The reality is quite different. The low-salaried employees consider loan payments as their moral obligations, and pay loan amount on or before time. There are always exceptions however, and some low-salaried employees would delay or default their loan payments. In India, unfortunately, few poor farmers committed suicides because of getting spiraled into debt and their incapability of making EMI payments. Whereas, the owners of rich companies declare bankruptcies, and continue to live lavish life. There are multiple other reasons why banks do not want to cater to low-salaried individuals; the ticket size of loans are small, and it is difficult for banks to make money on small loans. If an individual had a settlement 5 or 10 years ago, then he/she might not be able to acquire a personal loan from a bank. P2P lending platforms have built new credit models that can cater to loan requirements of most individuals. Since the platform is online, it can reach out to most individuals.Why should a borrower go to a P2P lending platform instead of walk-in to a bank for a loan? Well, the banks, by and large, ask us to submit a ton of documents that necessitates to make multiple trips to the bank branch, thereby consuming much more time than anticipated to get a loan application processed. At P2P lending platform, your loan application is approved within a day, and you could obtain funds in less than a week. You would quickly get to know whether lenders are interested in funding your loan request or not. The process is transparent, and seamless to all parties. In the coming years, it will be possible to get an emergency loan request dealt with online through mobile phone on P2P lending platforms, and get the requested loan amount acknowledged in the bank account in minutes, and not days or months.";social economy;http://www.p2p-banking.com/countries/india-why-do-we-need-p2p-lending-in-india/

415;"The easy saver account at my bank pays a princely 0.25% interest. If I open up its cash Isa and take advantage of my tax-free allowance instead, the rate moves up to 0.8%. If I am prepared to move the money and put it in the very highest paying instant savings account in the market, the amount of interest crawls up to just 1.65% ñ and that from a bank even I have never heard of. On top of this, the Bank of England, at its latest monthly meeting this week, decided yet again to hold the base rate at 0.5%. With no sign of ever getting a decent return on my cash, I have finally capitulated.For years we have written in Guardian Money about the tantalising rates on offer from ìpeer-to-peerî lenders. These are the internet-only operations which offer a sort of lonely hearts service for people who have money, matching them up with people who want to borrow it. By cutting out the banks they offer much higher rates of interest.First out of the blocks in 2004 was Zopa, and it has since had £1bn come through its doors. RateSetter and Funding Circle are probably the best known names among the many P2P operators that have launched since, with varying success. Rates on offer vary from 3% to north of 8%, depending on the credit quality (or not) of the borrower. More recent arrivals such as Folk2Folk promise 6.5% interest, claiming that this is rock solid and secured against property. With no sign of ever getting a decent return on my cash, I have finally capitulated But like 99% of savers, Iíve thought, yes, interesting, but Ö too risky. No Financial Services Compensation Scheme protection; no branch where I can pop down and demand my money back. Instead, my cash temporarily sits on some server in Greenland, its return dependent on the fancy metrics used to discern if an applicant will pay me back or not. Worse, the P2P lenders generally want you to lock your money away for three to five years ñ terms often longer than the company has been in existence.But last month I took the plunge. RateSetter has an account which locks your money away for just one month and pays interest of around 3%-3.5% (it dips up and down hour by hour as lenders and borrowers are matched up). It was shockingly easy to open ñ in little more than three minutes I had an account and transferred across £5,000. Matching it with borrowers took rather longer ñ another 24 hours ñ but I was told I would earn 3.1%.A month later I received my first statement. And what a huge disappointment it was. My £5,000 had earned a miserable £4.51 ñ equivalent to just 1% interest rather than the £12.92 implied by the 3.1% rate I was promised. Fortunately, when I checked again two days later it was looking more realistic: my account showed interest paid of £12.42. Meanwhile, the money has been automatically reinvested for another month, this time achieving (Iím told) 3.3%.I asked RateSetter to explain how I got £12.42 rather than £12.92. I got a comprehensive explanation, but in short, itís complicated ñ to do with maturity dates on various loans taken by borrowers, one of which one finished a day earlier than another. From next April savers will be able to put as much as £15,240 into a P2P Isa and shelter it tax-free My conclusion? Iím rather keen on it. A colleague has been with Zopa for years and has lost just £7 in borrower defaults. On the plus side, the P2P sector, while unlikely to ever be covered by the FSCS, has had an endorsement from financial regulators, of sorts. From next April savers will be able to put as much as £15,240 into a P2P Isa and shelter it tax-free. The predictions are for a huge new influx of money, and a tiny part of it will probably be mine.That said, if there is one thing we have learned from the financial crisis, itís that as much as we may hate the big banks, we know they will always be rescued by the government. Lloyds is ìsystemically importantî to the UK financial set up; Zopa and RateSetter are not. There will be no government lifeboat to rescue you if they sink.";social economy;http://www.theguardian.com/money/blog/2015/oct/10/ratesetter-funding-circle-zopa-interest-peer-p2p-lenders
416;"Savers are earning almost 10 per cent a year by lending online through banking's answer to eBay.Peer to peer or P2P lenders, to use their cyber-savvy name, are auction sites for potential lenders and borrowers who bid an amount and an interest rate.The biggest are RateSetter_, aimed at ordinary investors, and SocietyOne_, which caters for professionals.The most common reason borrowers apply for a peer-to-peer loan is to buy a new car.The most common reason borrowers apply for a peer-to-peer loan is to buy a new car. Photo: Supplied  Both run the credit checks for you. Still, it's a big jump from investing in a government-guaranteed term deposit to an unsecured loan to somebody you don't know and never will.Advertisement But so far the risk is paying off.Borrowers, who bid for a lower rate than the banks would charge them, are also winners.RateSetter has also adopted a banking convention of a reserve for bad loans with a provisions fund financed by a charge on borrowers based on their risk rating. Although designed to bail out lenders in a default on a loan, access isn't automatic ñ it's a call by RateSetter.But so far $10 million has been lent without any defaults.Besides a much better rate and higher risk, there are other striking differences with a term deposit.The terms of P2P lending can be more fluid than the fixed certainty of a term deposit.Take RateSetter's one-month loan. In reality the term can easily drag out to one year because, like a bank that borrows short and lends long, it has to find new lenders to replenish funds.Similarly a one-year loan can stretch all the way out to two years though you still get paid the same interest rate.The three and five-year terms are locked in so you get some of your principal back each month along with the interest.So with a five-year loan, for example, of 60 instalments you would have all your capital back after 3.75 years.While an advantage over a term deposit, where the whole amount is untouchable for five years, this can also be a trap. You earn the same interest rate but it's on a shrinking amount. Unless the repayments are re-invested they'll sit there earning nothing.Another thing. Just as banks hate creditworthy customers paying their debt off early, so will you. It means the money has to be re-lent at a potentially lower interest rate.Colin Bernasconi lent $10,000 for three years at 7.4 per cent after taking the 10 per cent RateSetter fee into account three months ago.He has no idea who borrowed it, and doesn't care.RateSetter did all the credit checking but keeps borrowers and lenders anonymous from each other. Loans can be secured or unsecured but you don't know which one you'll be signed up for.""It seems to be mainly car loans. A loan is more solid if it's being used to buy a vehicle, so there's a physical asset, rather than, say, paying for a honeymoon.""It's a great concept ñ I'll definitely be lending more. But if I see drawdowns from the provision fund I will reduce my loans,"" Bernasconi says.Nor is he fazed by the fact RateSetter doesn't reveal the credit ratings of borrowers.""You don't see the score but you have the provision fund instead. That's better than waiting for somebody to default,"" he says.Bernasconi is thinking about drawing down the offset account on his mortgage, which pays 5 per cent, and lending it at 8 per cent.""It's a higher risk but worthwhile and it's not a lot of money,"" he says.Most lenders start small to make sure all is above board then top up their loans. The  minimum loan is just $10.In the year since RateSetter started ""there has been no loan default so far. In the UK (where it originated five years ago) the default rate is under 1 per cent,"" chief executive Daniel Foggo says.The main reason is that RateSetter's credit rating approved borrowers ""are people who could get a loan from a bank, not those who can't.""But ANZ Bank's chief executive Mike Smith has warned P2P loan defaults are low because so are interest rates.""When people get burnt, the question is going to be asked, why are you being burnt, who regulated it?""Still, so far so good. The biggest credit union, CUA, is even reportedly looking at partnering with P2P lenders because of their ""very strong understanding"" of risk.RateSetter's average borrower owns a home and earns $90,000, Foggo says.""The most common reason for borrowing is to buy a car.""The average amount lent is $7000 and $40,000 for DIY super funds.Going rates are around 4 per cent for one month, 5 per cent for one year, 8 per cent for three years and 10 per cent for five years, according to RateSetter's website.Read more: http://www.smh.com.au/money/peertopeer-lenders-attract-investors-with-doubledigit-returns-20150923-gjtht0.html#ixzz3qL69cA89 Follow us: @smh on Twitter | sydneymorningherald on Facebook";social economy;http://www.smh.com.au/money/peertopeer-lenders-attract-investors-with-doubledigit-returns-20150923-gjtht0.html
417;"BANKING is undergoing a major transition. No longer the only choice for consumers, banks are facing a tsunami of competition from non-traditional competitors. There are online, non-bank financial services for everything a consumer needs, from loans, to investments, to money transfers, and more. The field is filling quickly with born-in-the-cloud ""fintech"" companies, leveraging the most advanced technologies and data analytics to serve up a host of alternatives to the public. While analysts and media often pronounce these trends as threats to banking globally, the reality is far more nuanced and the outlook more positive, in my view. Banking may be facing its greatest challenges, but at the same time as being presented with its greatest opportunities. By the people, for the people? Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending began with an objective to democratise financial services by using technology to match borrowers and lenders. Viewed favourably by many governments because of its positive role in widening access to finance for small businesses, P2P lending has seen a meteoric rise since 2007. However, it is important to note that P2P still remains a tiny part of overall lending. Also, in most instances, P2P lending companies provide the technology, but aren't the actual lenders. They don't take any credit risk, don't hold loans on their balance sheet and still use a bank in the middle to write loans and sell them to investors. The majority of P2P lenders' income is derived from upfront fees deducted from new loans. This front-loading of their revenues and the fact that they have no skin in the game, make P2P lending platforms very risky for investors who are looking for long-term returns. While investors may be attracted by the prospect of higher returns, P2P investments are not guaranteed or insured by governments or other sources, which means that investors could lose their capital in case of credit defaults. In addition, the fixed-rate nature of P2P loans exposes investors to market risks. China is currently the largest P2P lending market in the world, with CreditEase leading the charge. Estimates suggest that there are more than 1,500 active platforms in China alone. As the P2P lending industry has grown, it has become a magnet for institutional investors such as hedge funds. In fact, the majority of P2P lenders are no longer ""peers"", but institutional investors. P2P companies have morphed into marketplace lending platforms that are sporting eye-popping public and private market valuations. This dependency on wholesale funding is a fundamental flaw. History has taught us several lessons about finance companies that get all of their funding from the capital markets. The model works well in good times, but can quickly hit the wall when institutional funding is tight or prohibitively expensive. As competition builds up and interest rates normalise, many P2P lending companies will face liquidity pressures, declining spreads and increasing temptation towards adverse credit selection to maintain top-line growth. The changing credit and liquidity conditions in China in recent months have resulted in the failure of several hundred P2P lending companies. Big professional companies are likely to survive and thrive, but we should expect several more failures and significant consolidation as P2P lending weathers its first full economic cycle. With the meteoric growth of P2P lending will also come increased regulatory attention and scrutiny. The US Treasury has initiated a study of the benefits and risks associated with these platforms, while the China Banking Regulatory Commission is expected to issue guidelines to the P2P lending industry that has grown rapidly in a lightly controlled environment. The role of regulation Consumer education and regulation have a role to play to protect retail investors. While the investment risk disclosures are reasonably comprehensive in countries such as the US, it's not clear how many retail investors read or understand these. In countries such as China, the disclosures can be vague and there is limited transparency on the end-use of investments. While some economies have chosen to ban P2P lending, others such as Singapore and Hong Kong are opting for a cautious approach to protect retail investors via greater licensing requirements or restricted participation. Regulators around the world are reflecting on appropriate regulations for fintech companies conducting banking business, as they try to balance financial stability and consumer protection with economic growth. It is not inconceivable that, in the future, regulators will regulate financial activities, rather than licensed institutions, meaning that P2P lenders may face tougher restrictions. Despite these issues, any forward-looking bank will recognise the potential of P2P lending platforms and the greater ecosystem of fintech start-ups. The role played by P2P lending |in providing small businesses with hard-to-come-by finance, and wider benefits to economic growth, is important. Marriage of convenience? P2P lending offers opportunities for international banks on multiple fronts. The US and China may provide sufficient scale for these companies to thrive, but most emerging markets are fragmented and have varying credit infrastructure and regulatory complexities, making partnerships with established banks a necessity.  Emerging-market banks with large customer bases and deep understanding of the credit and regulatory environment need to take an active role in shaping the future of P2P lending, by supporting the growth of new entrants and forming win-win relationships. Perhaps marriages of convenience with P2P lending platforms can help banks attract new clients and stimulate much-needed innovation. While a profound transformation of banking is inevitable, for the foreseeable future at least incumbent banks and technology disruptors are destined to be in a symbiotic relationship where each benefits from the other, enhancing the overall value proposition for clients.";social economy;http://www.nationmultimedia.com/business/Peer-to-peer-lending-banking-industrys-wake-up-cal-30270747.html
418;"Regulatory consultancy Bovill states that many aspiring peer to peer lending platforms are having a change of heart.  According to a release published by the firm, 26% of P2P lending applicants have withdrawn their request as they are concerned they will not be able to meet the FCAís regulatory requirements.Since the beginning of 2014, the FCA has received 114 applications to launch P2P platforms. Since that time, 30 have been withdrawn.  Bovill clarifies that 23 of these were ìpartially withdrawnî as the firms in question intend on proceeding with other regulated activities.Presently 178 P2P lenders are operating with ìinterim permissionî.  The FCA took over responsibility from the Office of Fair Trading and the transition is one that is described as raising the standards to ensure consumer protection.Gillian Roche-SaundersGillian Roche-Saunders, Head of Venture Finance at Bovill, provided a statement on his firmís findings;ìThe high number of withdrawals suggests that the FCA is setting the bar high when it comes to full authorisation for P2P lenders- the process appears to be much tougher and more costly than many firms first anticipated.îìP2P lenders have enjoyed a relatively light touch approach from the regulator for some time. A rigorous authorisation process will have come as a shock to the system, particularly for smaller and less profitable lenders.îìThe FCA is now leaving no stone unturned- looking carefully at how firms meet strict consumer protection requirements. They are particularly focused on conduct risk and on ensuring P2P lenders have the right level of experience in their management teams. The regulator is likely to put pressure on those they feel are not up to scratch to withdraw their application at an early stage.îìMany firms are now hiring compliance officers or sourcing external advice to help them navigate the authorisation process.

419;Hand over your money to hundreds of strangers, trusting that they pay the money back plus interest: it sounds like a venture for the most risk-prone of investors ñ or the plain reckless. Yet peer-to-peer (P2P) lending has exploded in popularity. In a decade, £2.6bn has been lent out by 100,000 Britons in peer-to-peer loans with investors putting away around £6,000 each. It matches the typical amount held in cash Isas. The Government has noted this and will, from next April, allow the inclusion of these ìsavingsî in Isas. Research published today predicts this will lead to a fourfold take-up. Yorkshire Building Society said 405,000 savers will plough their money into the new tax-free accounts. The Peer-to-Peer Finance Association (P2PFA) expects the sector to double in size every six months for the foreseeable future.  ;social economy;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/investing/11918793/Peer-to-peer-what-would-happen-to-returns-in-a-financial-crisis.html
420;The Bank of England will soon need to rediscover the use of its trigger finger and fire the starting gun on interest rate rises. Still expected to be slow and steady, tightening policy after nearly seven years of ultra cheap money will nevertheless have a sizeable impact on everything and everyone, pushing up borrowing costs and (hopefully) savings account interest rates too.For the peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms, which enable individuals and businesses to lend and borrow from each other without going through a traditional financial institution, this will be something of a new experience.Zopa, one of the marketís big beasts, was founded in 2005, before interest rates were slashed to their current level of 0.5 per cent. But as Louise Beaumont of GLI Finance, an investment company that invests through alternative finance platforms, says, ìalternative finance providers have taken root in a benign interest rate environment... It will be interesting to see how robust their business models are as the cost of capital starts to increase.î And this isnít the only impending development. From April next year, P2P will be eligible for inclusion in the Isa wrapper ñ the new Innovative Finance Isa. This tax incentive and regulatory stamp of approval is expected to drive much larger volumes of money into the sector. So what could all this mean for P2P as an option for investors, and for the industry itself? Investment through P2P platforms has grown rapidly over the past few years, by offering lenders better rates than high street banks, very low default rates (partly due to sophisticated credit check systems), and provision funds that will reimburse you if the debt goes bad. In the second quarter of this year, £500m of new money was lent through the eight major platforms, according to figures from the P2P Finance Association.There are a variety of models in operation. Zopa could be termed ìclassicî P2P. You choose a lending term, your money is put into a queue and is then split into chunks of £10 that are matched with borrowers. Each month, you receive interest and capital repayments, which you can choose to roll-over into other loans or take out.RateSetter is slightly different. It also allows you to set the term length, but you can determine what rate of interest you wish to receive on that loan. If no one bites, that money is left unlent, so there is a strong incentive to choose a reasonable rate. RateSetter has ambitions for its ìPeopleís Rateî ñ dynamically updating to reflect supply and demand on the platform ñ to replace tarnished benchmarks like Libor.Competitors include Assetz Capital, Lending Works, and variations on the theme like Landbay (which offers loans secured against buy-to-let properties) and LendInvest (which hosts secured property loans more generally).The platforms are relaxed about interest rates rising and the economic environment changing. Landbay has even put itself through stress tests (which it claims are based on Bank of England criteria) to show that loss rates on its loans will not prove a problem for lenders, even if the economy tanks and house prices fall by 20 per cent.Rhydian Lewis, chief executive of RateSetter, agrees that this ìodd [monetary] environment has allowed companies like RateSetter to get going. Itís no surprise that, after a period of massive dislocation, new business models emerge.î But he does not think ultra low rates are a precondition of P2Pís success. ìThe most obvious point is that companies like RateSetter will only thrive if they continue to offer good value,î he says. ìThatís the same if rates are at 0.5 per cent as if theyíre at 2 per cent.îBut will they remain good value? Given that they have already gone out of their way to find a bank-like product that pays much more than the typical savings account, people who use P2P lenders are probably more price sensitive than the average investor. ìI donít think they are people who work in the City staring at yield curves all day,î says Giles Andrews, chief executive of Zopa. ìBut they are more savvy.îWhen the Bank of England raises interest rates from rock bottom, and high street banks follow suit, one argument is that P2P will suddenly look less attractive. ìIt could be a major issue for those firms which rely on retail investors, who are now drawn to it in search of higher returns than traditional investment can offer, if they withdraw from the sector and go back to other asset classes as interest rates rise,î says Beaumont.This may not be an issue for two reasons. First, the inclusion of P2P in the Isa wrapper from next year means lenders will effectively get higher returns (given they wonít be paying income tax) anyway. Second, there is an opaque connection between Bank Rate and high street savings account rates. While the base rate has remained at 0.5 per cent for nearly seven years, in April 2011 the average saver could earn 2.7 per cent on a one-year fixed rate Isa, according to Bank of England figures. In August this year, it was just 1.5 per cent.The platforms also say that this is the wrong way of looking at it. Like banks, they operate within the spread between the rate received by lenders and paid by borrowers. Itís their contention that, due to their simpler, more focused models, and the massive amounts of new regulation facing the banks since the financial crisis, they can continue to offer better rates for both borrowers and lenders, regardless of what happens to Bank Rate.ìWhen we launched our business in 2005, bank spreads were narrow,î says Andrews. ìBecause the world was awash with cheap money back then, people were mispricing risk.î During and after the crisis, he says, bank spreads widened dramatically. Importantly, however, the return of liquidity has not seen spreads narrow again. ìI believe we have maintained a structural cost advantageÖ I think bank spreads have returned to what will be their long-term level.îDEFAULTSThere is another dimension to this, however. Investments through the P2P platforms are not backed by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (which reimburses an individual up to £85,000 per institution, if that institution should fail), but default rates have been very low. Lending Works, which has both a reserve fund (to cover arrears) and an insurance policy to reimburse you for bad debt, had a 0.45 per cent default rate in 2014. Historical bad debt on Zopa (which also has a safeguard fund) has been 0.6 per cent since 2005. All the platforms have their own ways of minimising the risks to your money.But some are concerned about the impact steadily rising interest rates will have on P2P loans. ìThe issue for lenders to be aware of is that people who have borrowed via unsecured P2P sites are likely to have other debts or outgoings which may be on a floating rate basis,î says Andy Sweeney, head of fixed income products at Ablrate.com. ìRepayments on mortgages, credit card bills, and car loan payments would all be prioritised by borrowers above an unsecured P2P loan from anonymous lenders.îWhen the tightening cycle begins, therefore, Sweeney expects default rates on unsecured P2P loans to increase more rapidly than those for, say, mortgages. ìNone of the platforms have been through a full economic cycle that includes rising rates. In a debtdriven society, itís a rising rate environment that could be a threat.îRISKThis doesnít mean there is a problem with P2P, of course. It is just one of the risks to be aware of. ìObviously lenders can avoid thisÖ by looking underneath the loan that they are investing in to become acquainted with all of the liabilities of the borrower,î says Sweeney. And some platforms are more transparent about the underlying loans than others. He also doesnít expect P2P loan rates will need to rise until base rates get to 2.5 per cent or more (which is likely to be some time away).Will a rising interest rate environment mean people become more attuned to risk? ìIt should doî, says Andrews. ìI would like to think that people should be conscious about risk performance. They should look at the long-run performance of all investments, and make the most informed decision they can.îAnd the platforms are more than aware of the potential impact of the economic environment changing. ìOne of the advantages of the provision fund model [wherein borrowers via RateSetter pay a fee into a fund to cover expected future defaults] is that we recognise that youíre going to have cycles ñ good lending years and bad lending years,î says Lewis.So the next few years will be a crucial test. Will this exciting new model struggle in the face of rising defaults and disappointed investors? Or will it be able to prove its maturity and come out the other side stronger?;social economy;http://www.cityam.com/225433/breaking-bank

On Monday, it halted an ongoing rights issue after new management discovered misconduct including allocation of new lender capital to existing bad debt.At least £21m of lendersí money remains trapped on the platform.Simon Nathanson, non-executive chairman of TrustBuddy, said: ìThe new management found indications of misconduct within the company and initiated an investigation. The findings were very disappointing so far.ìThe investigation shows a number of breaches against internal and external regulation.îThe platform found lenders were owed £3.6m more than was held in client accounts, while £3m loaned to borrowers was not assigned to any lender. The problems occurred in TrustBuddyís core short-term consumer lending operation, effectively a payday lender.The misuse of funds was uncovered after Philip Mikal, who joined from the payments provider Klarna, took over as chief executive this month. The company said the misconduct had ìlikelyî been happening since the platform began operations.TrustBuddy reported the findings to Swedenís Financial Services Authority, which insisted it shut down operations immediately. Trading in its shares has also been suspended.The company said it was working with police and regulators, while hoping to be back in operation ìsoonî. It said it would return as much money as possible to lenders.TrustBuddy acquired the Dutch business lending platform Geldvoorekar in 2014, but that operation has not been affected, since it was run as a standalone enterprise, TrustBuddy said.In business since 2009, TrustBuddy was a pioneer in the sector and had set out ambitious expansion plans, including in Spain and the UK. But it ran into financing problems in early 2015 and carried out a cost-cutting exercise, while saying its portfolio included ìtoo much non-performing debtî. Louise Beaumont, head of public affairs at UK-based GLI Finance, which invests in alternative finance platforms, said: ìThis is a nascent sector, and itís one reason why we have been calling for appropriate and enforced regulation for so long.îShe added: ìWe have seen unacceptable practice like this and we have been flagging it as a concern for some time. We have rejected businesses at the due diligence stage where the client money was not segregated.îTrustBuddy said it had not identified who was responsible for the misconduct, but had suspended members of the previous management who are still employed by the company. Jens B. Glas¯, the companyís founder, could not be reached for comment.The European alternative finance market grew by almost 150 per cent to Ä3bn in 2014, but most of that took place in the UK; some Ä620m was in continental Europe.The UK has pioneered regulation specific to peer-to-peer and is in the process of bringing platforms into a full regulatory regime, including rules on client money segregation and ìliving willsî in case platforms collapse.Sweden, also home to platforms such as Lendify and FundedByMe, regulates the platforms under existing rules on consumer and business lending.";social economy;http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/8342ca10-71a2-11e5-ad6d-f4ed76f0900a.html#axzz3qL7JW0D6
422;It was the view from the other side of the fence that helped convince Simon Champ that the peer-to-peer (P2P) sector was worth taking a closer look at. Now, less than two years after launch, the P2P Global Investment (P2P ) trust run by Champ, chief executive of investment managers Eaglewood Europe, is among the 30 biggest London-listed investments trusts and recently entered the FTSE 250. The trust targets an annual dividend yield of 6% to 8% of the issue price, which was £10. In the two decades preceding his foray into the P2P (or marketplace lending) world, Champ worked as a broker at Dresdner and Cazenove and was a founder of Liberum, the boutique investment bank. ëPrivately I had a big interest in disintermediation and I was a small, day one investor in Betfair. Thatís the model that P2P followed, using the internet to disintermediate,í he said. ëWe could see the potential and working in a bank I could also see the other side of disintermediation myself.í On the march The P2P sector is widely acknowledged as a genuine disintermediation threat to banks, with KPMG predicting the sector will ëfundamentally transform the saving and borrowing industry in the coming yearsí. For that to happen, however, P2P firms will need more capital. ëIn early 2013 we went to meet platforms and saw the same growth issues eBay and Betfair had in their early years: they had an uneven situation with more buyers than sellers, because selling is far more involved than buying.í Champ (pictured) left Liberum in November 2013 and was invited to join Marshall Wace (owner of Eaglewood Europe), launching the trust in June the following year. It was the first investment trust focusing on platform-originated loans and raised £200m ëlargely from investors I had worked with over the preceding 15 years, providing them with an equity income vehicleí. While P2P lending was growing quickly it was capital constrained, with far more borrowers than lenders. Champ saw that as an opportunity to bridge the gap by becoming the first value-added wholesale provider of capital to platforms. ëWhen they switch on their computers on a Monday morning, platforms donít know if theyíll get borrowers or lenders. ëIf they have visibility on one side of the equation, lending, their marketing budget halves and they can spend what theyíve saved on lenders and devote more resources to targeting the right high-quality borrowers,í he said. Big hitters Institutions rather than retail investors already provide the bulk of capital to P2Ps in the US and further fund raising by the trust in summer 2015 attracted the likes of Woodford Investment Management, M&G Investments, Aviva Investors and Newton Investment Management. The trust has arrangements with leading platforms, including US market leader Lending Club and UK pioneer Zopa.ëDue diligence on platforms is important and we look at things like the collection process, regulatory and risk controls investment strength and IT,í Champ said. Just 16 of the 200 or so P2P firms around the world that have contacted the trust have been selected as partners. The lending book is 70% consumer loans and 30% small and medium-sized businesses, while geographically, 65% is US, 34% the UK and 1% New Zealand. The immaturity of the P2P sector, still very much a US and UK affair, poses a problem when it comes to geographic diversification. However, there are signs the trust will soon be able to spread the net wider. ëWeíve got a relationship with a New Zealand platform called Harmoney, so weíre building geographical diversification.

425;City minister Harriett Baldwin has branded peer to peer lending a ìbrilliantly innovative new form of finance ñ which we want to see continue to grow and evolve.î In a speech to the Peer-to-Peer Finance Association (P2PFA) Summit in London yesterday (21 October), Ms Baldwin said peer-to-peer lending can plug the funding gap for small businesses.Ms Baldwin said: ìI am proud of the fact that the UK has the largest P2P and alternative finance sector in Europe. Weíve worked hard for that.ìWe knew, for example, that for the sector to mature, it would be important to bring it within the correct statutory framework. Proportionate regulation will protect consumers lending and borrowing via a P2P platform and allow the sector to continue to grow.ìP2P platforms and fintech provide competition, ideas, and technologyñ making peopleís lives better and the markets more effective. When you do well, your businesses flourish. Excellence breeds excellence.ìCustomers have the services they need to meet their aspirations. And this country becomes better off, as a result of all this activity taking place here in the UK. We are ambitious, because you are ambitious too. I can sense the energy in this room.ìThe businesses here ñ from Funding Circle to RateSetter to Zopa ñ are some of the most innovative in Europe.îThe MP for West Worcestershire highlighted the fact as part of the savings package announced in the March 2015 Budget, the Conservatives confirmed they would expand the range of products that can be held in stocks and shares Isas to include loans made through P2P platforms.Holding P2P loans within an Isa will mean that interest received on the loans will not be subject to tax. These rules will come into force from the start of the next tax year, on 6 April 2016.From earlier this year, investors in P2P platforms have also been allowed to offset any losses from P2P loans which go bad against other P2P income, reducing the amount of income tax that the individual has to pay on the P2P interest.Ms Baldwin said: ìThe objective here is to level the playing field, and make P2P more attractive to investors by equalising the advantage banks and other investment products have over them.ìWe have also been consulting with industry on the implementation of new withholding tax obligations, to apply across all P2P lending platforms from April 2017. ìI appreciate the engagement this sector has had with the government on this issue, and we will be publishing our response soon ñ watch this space.îMs Baldwinís gushing praise for P2P came after new research revealed that 40 per cent of people would consider investing in peer to peer when the Innovation Isa launches next April.;social economy;http://www.ftadviser.com/2015/10/22/mortgages/mortgage-products/treasury-sings-praises-of-peer-to-peer-lenders-BgeIbJkyCUNQCxXx9Pp9WJ/article.html
426;On October 1st Jevgenijs Kazanins became new CEO of Latvian p2p lending marketplace Twino. He previously worked as CMO at Estonian p2p lending marketplace Bondora. Twino was launched in June and is part of the Finabay group which operates since 2009. So far all loans offered on the p2p lending marketplace are from Latvia, whereas the Finabay group is active in a broader set of markets. Twino is open to international investors ñ German retail investors are the largest foreign investor base.In a call with P2P-Banking.com the new CEO outlined the expansion plans. Twino will add loans from new markets, starting with polish loans shortly and possibly adding loans from countries like Russia, Denmark or Georgia at a later stage. There will be no currency risk for investors as it will be covered by Twino. Twino will apply its buyback guarantee to all loans ñ by which Twino covers overdue principal and interest for investors once a loan is 60 days overdue (though due to extensions this might take 8 month). The interest rate offered to investors for p2p loans in the new markets will be in line with the current offering: up to 14.9%. The loan terms will likely longer and Twino will move away from the current very short term loans many of which I deem essentially payday loans. He said: ëÖ we are working on introduction of the loans from other markets, where Finabay has lending operations, such as Poland, Russia, Georgia and Denmark. The reason for the inclusion of other countries is that the demand from investors has already surpassed the volumes we can originate in Latvia. We aim to offer similar rates to the Latvia-originated loans and all loans will also come with the buyback guaranteeëJevgenijs Kazanins, TwinoSince the mother company Finabay is already originating these loans, it will not be a challenge to build loan volume. Kazanins aims to originate 5 million Euro loan volume per month. As the loans already exist and the new aspect consists only of refinancing through p2p investors, Kazanins is convinced of the good quality of the loans: ëWe estimate that 15-20% of [polish] loan volume will be bought back through the BuyBack Guarantee program (defaulted loans and loans with more than 6 extensionsë.Twino also works to add statistics to the site. He stated: ë Ö Disclosing information about financial health of Finabay is highly important given the fact that all loans offered on the platform come with the buyback guarantee ÖëLoan extensions on Twino frequently prompt questions by investors. Kazanins has described in detail how loan extensions on Twino work here.Kazanins pledged responsiveness to investor wishes and requests: ëThe goal of Twino is to facilitate not only the monetary exchange, but also the exchange of information between the investors and the lenders. Let me explain what I mean by that: through their investment decisions investors are communicating their preferences in terms of rates, loan amounts, duration, data disclosure, borrower profiles, etc. Lenders in turn can use this new, previously unavailable, information to innovate and grow their business.Obviously, this puts a lot of pressure on Twino in terms of openness to investor feedback, flexibility of the platform, data transparency, etc., but Finabay is a very innovative and technologically advanced company, so I am very optimistic about the future of Twino.í;social economy;http://www.p2p-banking.com/countries/poland-new-twino-ceo-has-big-expansion-plans/
427;"About two in five American families canít pay their credit card bills, carrying over a median of $3,800 a month, according to a 2015 Pew Charitable Trusts study. Many drag around far more debt than that.An increasingly popular solution is peer-to-peer lending. Lending Club and Prosper, the two largest peer-to-peer lenders, are online platforms that directly connect debtors with investors. By cutting banks out of the lending process, they claim to offer lower rates and better terms to borrowers.Both companies are on track to at least double their lending this year from 2014, when Lending Club lent $4.4 billion and Prosper lent $1.6 billion. Their core business is refinancing credit card debt, though theyíre branching out into loans for home improvement, surgeries, and even vacations.Are peer-to-peer lenders the best option for credit card debt?Prosper and Lending Club do have important advantages. Their online application processes make it easy to quickly pool all your credit card balances in one consolidated loan. Your interest rate is fixed, and payments are spread over three or five years. But while some borrowers with pristine credit can get rates in the single digits, the average annual percentage rate (APR) of peer-to-peer loans isnít much lower than a typical credit card's. Such loans also can be a temporary measure that doesnít fix the underlying problems.ìIt is never a good idea to borrow your way out of debt, especially if the debt is already unmanageable,î Bruce McClary, of the National Foundation for Credit Counseling, said. So what is a good way to get out from under a pile of debt?  Here's how peer-to-peer lending stacks up against more traditional services.Shopping for teaser ratesPro: If you shop around, some credit cards may offer you a lower rate than youíd get on a peer-to-peer loan. The average credit card APR is 15 percent, according to CreditCards.com.  If you have good credit, you may be offered a card with a teaser rate as low as zero percent.Prosper charges an average interest rate of 13.4 percent, and its average APR, including fees, is 16.2 percent. Lending Club doesn't disclose its average APR, but its average interest rate is 13.1 percent, and its fees are similar to Lending Club's ó a one-time origination fee that is 5 percent for all but the highest-quality borrowers. Con: Thereís often a fee of 3 or 4 percent to transfer funds to a teaser credit card. Also, teaser rates last only for a typical introductory period of 6 or 12 months and then can spike. The payments and rates on peer-to-peer loans are fixed, no matter what happens to interest rates over the next few years.Some borrowers will have trouble shopping around. They may find theyíre stuck with credit cards with APRs of 20 percent or more. For them, peer-to-peer loans are a great option ñ if they qualify.1increase click area When borrowers go from credit cards to a Lending Club loan, their interest rates drop by a third on average, or by about 7 percentage points.Credit counselingPro: Nonprofit credit counseling isn't just for people with huge, unmanageable debt. A credit counselor might enroll you in a debt management plan. These plans don't reduce the total amount you owe, but counselors can negotiate with creditors and slash your interest rates, typically by half. At Cambridge Credit Counseling Corp., the average borrower APR fell from 21.8 percent to 10.6 percent.Con: Nonprofit credit counselors are often confused with for-profit debt settlement firms. Consumers should ask about counselorsí accreditations and make sure theyíre charging reasonable fees on a debt management plan. The average monthly fee at the nonprofit GreenPath Debt Solutions is $36.Debt management plans aren't for the faint of heart. If you enroll, you typically need to cut up all your credit cards, stick to a budget, and refrain from taking out any new debt for a few years. Itís designed to be a more comprehensive solution for chronically indebted people than just taking out another loan. ìItís more than just paying back your debt,î said Kathryn Bossler, a counselor at GreenPath in Detroit. ìItís a different way of thinking about debt in general.îClosing down credit card accounts may hurt your credit score a bit, at least initially. In a peer-to-peer loan, by contrast, you can keep all your accounts open after you pay them off. That may actually increase your credit score, by moving debt from revolving credit cards to an installment loan. Of course, you may be tempted to rack up debt all over again.  Debt settlementPro: If a credit card company fears you canít pay back your debts, it may be willing to accept partial repayment. Consumers can hire debt settlement companies to help negotiate with creditors, but these firms can be expensive and arenít always effective. (The American Fair Credit Council, a group of debt settlement companies that call themselves the ""watchdogs"" of the industry, lists accredited member companies that agree to ethical standards and yearly audits.) You can avoid the fees by calling up the credit card companies yourself.Con: Typically, credit card companies negotiate only if you have the cash to settle at least some of your debts immediately. Charging off debt with a settlement can also be disastrous for your credit score. Finally, the fees at debt settlement companies can be confusing and complicated. Prosper and Lending Club pride themselves on a straightforward fee structure: Borrowers on both platforms pay an up-front fee of up to 5 percent of the loan.BankruptcyPro: Bankruptcy gives debtors a fresh start. Itís a comprehensive solution when your debt has grown so large you can't pay it off. State bankruptcy rules often shield debtorsí homes from creditors, and federal law generally protects retirement accounts.Con: Creditors will ostracize a bankrupt consumer, making it impossible ñ or a lot more expensive ñ to get a mortgage or car loan for as long as a decade. A bankruptcy is a matter of public record, and it still holds a stigma for many Americans and even for potential employers. Student loans usually canít be discharged in bankruptcy.People who qualify for Prosper or Lending Club are unlikely to be desperate enough to consider bankruptcy. They mostly want to simplify their debt, not wipe it out. ìThese are people who are employed,"" said Lending Club Chief Operating Officer Scott Sanborn. ""Theyíve got an income stream,"" and their debt load is manageable.Other kinds of loansPro: People can pay off credit cards with personal bank loans and home equity loans and by borrowing against their 401(k) retirement accounts. Through these methods, theyíll often borrow at much lower rates than through a credit card or peer-to-peer lender.Con: Borrowers get low rates because theyíve put up collateral. That makes these kinds of debts risky. If you canít pay back a home equity or 401(k) loan, you endanger your house or your retirement.";social economy;http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-15/should-you-cut-your-credit-card-debt-with-a-peer-to-peer-loan-

The agreement will provide existing bankís customers with a productive digital experience and will increase the bank's small business loan applications by an expected 33%, due to workflow automation and underwriting efficiencies. The bank counts assets of approximately $7.6 billion and serves small and medium sized businesses, professionals, individuals and families. It is a pioneer in online and mobile solutions, and it adopts a ìhigh-techî approach, with the aim of being a bank with less focus on the somewhat dated traditional branch model.  Using Biz2Creditís technology, the bank will now design a new platform that will offer small businesses plenty of cutting edge services, including loan application document uploads and real-time updates about their loan applications. Additionally, Biz2Credit's Virtual CFO platform will allow customers to constantly monitor their creditworthiness. The project will launch in early 2016. Jay Sidhu, chief executive officer, Customers Bank, commented:  ""We believe our partnership with Biz2Credit is the logical next step for us as we continue to focus on customer convenience. We are committed to providing our customers the technology they need to ensure an effortless banking experience."" Biz2Credit supports Customers Bankís mission and its ìhigh-techî approach in providing banking services to small businesses. We caught up with Rohit Arora, Biz2Credit chief executive officer, who provided us with more colour around this strategic partnership. He said:  ""We are excited to launch the first white label solution for a bank's small business customers. We also look forward to helping other financial institutions expand their technology to improve their internal and external small business lending capabilities."" When asked if banks such as Customers Bank ñ with less focus on the dated branch model ñ might represent a threat to the P2P lending industry, Rohit answered that it may well be a potential issue, and will be one to monitor in the future. If banks are able to shift away from their current business models towards a structure more focused on online services, competition will likely increase for P2P lenders. For now, however, weíre seeing more and more banks choosing to leverage platform technologies in order to improve their customers experience. For platforms, such deals represent a valuable method of swelling their customer base. However, Rohit does see a future where banks and platforms will ìwalk togetherî, providing small businesses with affordable and straightforward access to credit.  Additionally, Rohit commented on the general importance of partnerships for P2P online lending platforms, not only with banks, but also with other kinds of businesses. Biz2Credit is willing to find other partners, and indeed has recently tied up with the likes of Fortis Payment Systems and CPA.com. Rohit considers such unions to be critical to platforms from an origination standpoint.

430;"Banks with aging borrowers are using peer-to-peer lenders to pick up younger customers needing funds for ""life events"" such as getting married or buying a car, according to the co-founder of industry pioneer Society One.G&C Mutual Bank is the first of several banks to reveal it is making personal loans via SocietyOne, which was the first P2P lender to start in Australia three years ago. It was followed in November 2014 by UK based RateSetter. They will be joined in early October by another local rival MoneyPlace.Chief executive and co-founder of SocietyOne, Matt Symons, said G&C Mutual, which is a Sydney-based bank with about $700 million in assets on its books, and other credit unions, including the Maritime, Mining, Power Credit Union, have been lending on this platform for close to a year.Mr Symons expects his business and other P2P lenders to soon forge other mutually beneficial deals with more banks, as well as other businesses that have customers that need loans.MoneyPlace and RateSetter say they are working on similar deals. These ""marketplace"" lenders need to do get as many lenders and borrowers on their platforms as possible because this improves ""liquidity"", leading to better rates for borrowers.""A lot of mutual lenders have local, community lending in their DNA ñ people lending to people, so with marketplace lenders we are in a sense reconnecting these local community lenders to each other or, at a vertical level, a particular trade, job type or a sector, can lend to each other,"" Mr Symons said.""What you see is there are younger people who tend to need credit for life events like getting married, buying cars, getting a house and equally there are older members of the community who are net savers who could lend money.""G&C has also just started offering home loans tailored to individuals' credit scores. This is known as risk-based pricing. It is linking its offers to SocietyOne affiliated web site getcreditscore, which offers credit scores from credit bureau Veda Group for free.Under 30s highest number of applicantsG&C Mutual chief executive Dave Taylor, however, said the move is more about marketing to young people who are using the getcreditscore site.G&C has loaned about $2 million via SocietyOne (the site won't disclose how much in total has been loaned) over the past seven months. M&C has handed out more in personal loans directly in that time but Mr Taylor said he expects the amounts loaned via SocietyOne to quickly grow into the tens of millions of dollars and the big plus for it is that its borrowers are younger.""We have seen the demographics ñ the proportion of applicants under 30 is way higher than our normal channels,"" he told The Australian Financial Review.As well as lending to a new generation that doesn't care much about the personal touch pitch from credit unions, SocietyOne allows the banks to improve their profits by boosting their unsecured loans and diversify risk due to the ability to choose specific types of borrowers in precise geographic locations.MoneyPlace founder Stuart Stoyan, an ex NAB banker, said it also has several ""partnerships"" it is negotiating. These include becoming a financier for retailers' customers, where it would compete alongside credit cards, ""interest free"" loans and consumer leases.""The difference is we are a P2P lender not a balance sheet lender. If I am a balance sheet lender I am asking 'what price will the customer take?'. Our revenue model is different, it relies on fees, which means we can provide a better offer to a customer at the point of sale,"" he said.SocietyOne at present can only accept ""sophisticated investors"" but it is applying for a retail credit licence from ASIC. The only P2P lender able to accept retail lenders at the moment is RateSetter, which has had $220 million in loan applications so far, with $10 million loaned.But SocietyOne also lets investors make working capital loans to stock and station agents via a deal with Ray White. Mr Symons said it wants to offer lenders more small business borrowers as well as become a direct substitute for a credit cards via other distribution partners outside of banks.Deals boost net marginsThe biggest credit union in the country, CUA, has said it is also looking to do deals with P2P lenders to boost net interest margins above 2 per cent. Others are unconvinced the value they would get from investing in P2P will justify the cost.Peter Evers, the chief executive of People's Choice Credit Union ñ second in size to CUA ñ said it had kept a healthy personal loan book at about $500 million out of a total loan book of $6.6 billion, and maintains a better total net interest margin as a result on 2.3 per cent.He does not see an adequate return on investment from P2P and he doesn't use mortgage brokers for the same reason. He argues P2P lenders play the same middleman role as brokers in personal loans. However, Mr Evers said it would reconsider if it was paid a referral fee as part of any deal.""There is a lot of piloting and probing [between established and P2P lenders] and we are watching with interest but we are not just lending money for a revenue stream ñ it is to gain a relationship with a borrower,"" he said.

431;Starting peer-to-peer lending programs could help credit unions attract younger, value-focused members as well as compete effectively with alternative online lending platforms, according to a new report from the Filene Research Institute.Filene published ìPeer-to-Peer Lending and the Future of Cooperationî in association with Credit Union Central of Canada. Sean Geobey, an assistant professor in the University of Waterlooís School of Environment, Enterprise and Development, wrote the report.Drawing from events that took place in the United Kingdom, where peer-to-peer lending is more established, the report estimated the U.S. market for peer-to-peer consumer loans could grow to $5.1 billion per year and small business loans to $7 billion.Geobey identified three ways credit unions could begin exploring the adoption of peer-to-peer lending as part of their operations.First, credit unions could offer members a peer-focused platform that helps them fund local community and charitable projects that the credit union also supports, Geobey proposed.ìWhen a credit union involves mem≠bers and the broader community directly in its decision making, the role of the memberís voice is further highlighted,î Geobey wrote. ìAdditionally, as credit unions become increasingly sophisti≠cated in the use of ëbig dataí and retail experience design, the information members and people from the broader community provide as part of a crowdfunding-enhanced com≠munity development strategy can be rolled into these analytics. This can help credit unions identify new member recruitment channels and facilitate the design of new products and services, particularly impact investing products and new services for social enterprises, nonprofits and start_up co_ops,í he added.Geobey outlined how the Saskatchewan, Canada-based Affinity Credit Union reached out to its community partners and members to create a crowdfunding and peer-based funding contest to obtain financing for three start-up cooperatives: A bike shop, food co-op and solar power co-op.ìThe community benefited from the attention and support given to critical community issues, the three finalists benefited from increased awareness and development, and Affinity Credit Union was able to reaffirm its role as a progressive community leader and tap into a young, value-aligned, tech-savvy target market,î Geobey wrote.Second, as part of the consumer lending area, Geobey suggested a peer-to-peer approach might provide an important and lower-cost way of helping members get out of higher-priced predatory or exploitive loans and into more reasonably priced loans backed by the credit union. Geobey reported, for example, that 75% of leading peer-to-peer lender Lending Clubís loans had been taken out by consumers looking to refinance higher-priced debt.Third, in the small business loan area, Geobey wrote peer-to-peer lending had been among the approaches Canadian credit unions used to take a large share of their small business lending market.Canadian credit unions accounted for 17.4% of the countryís entire small- and medium-sized business loan market, Geobey reported.He also pointed out that in the U.K.ís mature mar≠ket, borrowers access online peer-to-peer loans more for better service and faster speeds than for lower interest rates. Business borrowers liked peer-to-peer loans because of their speed, ease of use, faster decisions, greater transparency and better service.;social economy;http://www.cutimes.com/2015/10/21/peer-to-peer-lending-offers-value-filene

This is according to multiple reports that the Estonian based platform has entered North American, skipping the US, and heading due North.Quoted in the Globe & Mail, Partel Tomberg, Bondora co-founder and CEO, stated;ìWe are able to provide investors with a diversified spread of different loan exposures in different jurisdictions, multiple geographies and various risk classes of loans. The borrowing markets we operate in have highly inefficient banking systems and limited alternative financing options for borrowers ñ thus ensuring premium returns to investors.îìOver time, we anticipate investment returns to somewhat decrease as we expand the platform to include new markets where the banking consumer-loan rates might be lower than in the current countries we presently working in,î he said. ìBut it will also further reduce the volatility and risk for investors.îP‰rtel TombergPeer to peer lending has stumbled a bit in Canada as regulators have not completely clarified how platforms will be regulated. The report stated that Bondora has yet to meet with regulators at the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) to discuss the situation.ìIf we arenít able to work directly with retail investors, we will look to see if we can work together with a securities provider ñ or a fund manager ñ who can help incorporate these loans into a more traditional portfolio that is sold to the retail investors. ìWe believe that this type of investment is superior to many other fixed income investments ñ of course, it can carry higher risks because it is unsecured personal loans but on a diversified portfolio basis it will provide an overall solid return to investors,î stated Tomberg.GroupLend, a home grown option based in Vancouver, ostensibly welcomed the competition. Kevin Sandhu, GroupLend CEO,  said Canadians may be more inclined to match up with a domestic platform;ìInvesting outside of Canada not only presents unique risks, but also takes away some of the social impact of investing. Investing abroad, particularly in emerging markets, can be a great way to diversify an investorís portfolio and gain more exposure to this exciting asset class, but we find many of our investors are as excited by the opportunity to help their fellow Canadians save money as they are in the prospect of compelling investment returns.îBondora 02Bondora is a fast growing direct lending platform that has quickly expanded into multiple European countries. Last year, Bondora went through the process of being approved by the UK FCA ñ without the intent of offering loans in the UK.Tomberg described Bondora as ìa typical dorm room startupî.

More than £200 million is lent out using failed firm TrustBuddy, which specialises in personal loans to individuals and business loans, which was operating under ""interim"" approval from the FCA. All peer-to-peer lenders must be approved by the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, but lenders' money is not protected under the official compensation scheme if a company goes bust, which guarantees up to £85,000 per institution, falling to £75,000 in January";social economy;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/investing/11932850/New-12pc-peer-to-peer-firm-freezes-investors-cash.html
434;Peer-to-peer lenders, which help to provide an alternative source of financing from high-street retail banks, may soon come under pressure from regulators, Britainís financial watchdog told MPs yesterday.John Griffiths-Jones, chairman of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), told the Treasury Select Committee that as peer-to-peer lenders and crowdfunders grow and begin to behave more like banks, they will need to be treated by regulation as such.ìWhile one wants to encourage alternative sources of lending, one doesnít want to open up risk,î Griffiths-Jones said. ìI think sooner or later these platforms will tend to offer packages rather than lending to individuals. ìAt that point, they become awfully like a bank, and I think itís very important for the regulator not to allow regulatory arbitrage in the system. What I can assure you is that weíre not asleep at this wheel. What I canít assure you is when is the right moment to intervene ñ but it is being kept under constant review.îPeer-to-peer lending and other forms of alternative financing have grown in popularity after the financial crisis caused a loss of public trust in traditional lenders, who were also constrained in the amount they could lend.Peer-to-peer sites often facilitate a transaction between a single borrower and a single lender, but the FCA expect more to shift to a port≠folio type of investment, where lenders will lend to more than one borrower, pooling their risk.Acting chief executive of the FCA Tracey McDermott said one per cent of peer-to-peer borrowers default on their loans, but that this figure is expected to climb as loans were starting to go ìfrom prime to sub-primeî borrowers.Peer-to-peer lenders currently account for only a fraction of the UKís lending but the sector is rapidly growing. They are currently regulated, but not to the same extent as retail banks. They also lack the deposit insurance enjoyed by retail banks.;social economy;http://www.cityam.com/227043/financial-conduct-authority-warns-peer-to-peer-lenders-may-face-same-rules-as-banks
435;"One of the UKís more nascent peer-to-peer outfits is closing its doors to retail money.  Peer-to-peer mortgage platform Fruitful appears to going through a major pivot. A quick visit to help.lovefruitful.com provides some colour as to the current state of the company. ìHave I lost any of my money?î is the first of five pinned posts on the platform's ìhelpî page. The answer to that question is as follows: ìNo. As of writing (23rd October, 2015), weíre still working to offload the remaining mortgage balances on loan. As a bonus, youíll continue to earn interest on these loans each month until they are settled.î  The help page also provides clarity as to whether or not the company is going bust. The answer is that Fruitful is not going bust, but rather it is ìchanging directionî. The company will continue to serve as a marketplace for borrowing and lending, but the contributors to the latter half of that equation will be changing shape. Retail investors will no longer be able to access the deals that are originated by the platform. Instead, Fruitful will be partnering with a small number of ìlong termî investors that are looking for access to low risk, low yield opportunities ñ the kind that the platform believes are not attractive to retail investors. The remaining three questions are seemingly designed to address the concerns of existing retail investors. What we can glean is that some retail investor money is still out on loan, and that the secondary market has been closed off ñ meaning that loan parts may not be sold in the short term. The loan exchange was shut down because the platform is no longer accepting new investments. But investors will reportedly continue to receive interest until all outstanding loans have been settled, at which point all principal and interest owed should have been returned. Fruitful has indicated that it is working to have the outstanding loans fully remortgaged and repaid within the next 12 months. In other words, it would appear that Fruitful is trying to settle up all existing loans prior to their maturation ñ given that the platformís borrowers are able to access loans of up to £1m for terms of between 5 and 15 years. Can existing lenders leave their money in the platform, and continue to earn 6% per annum? They cannot. The days of retail investors putting money to work on the Fruitful platform are finished. The platform has indicated that any new deposits will be returned to the originating bank account. Fruitful launched in late November 2014, with a view to simplifying the world of mortgages. The platform is fully regulated by the FCA. Fruitful offers a range of products, including commercial mortgages, buy-to-let mortgages and property renovation and development loans. From the outset the company marketed itself as a highly secure peer-to-peer investment proposition, featuring minimum LTVs of 65%, automatic diversification of investor money and a contingency mechanism named the ìCanopy Fundî. Upon launch, Fruitful also promised that investors would be able to withdraw funds early, at no additional cost, and that such withdrawals would take on average 1 week to execute. The Fruitful pivot is of dual relevance to the alternative finance space, in that the company raised £140k of seed stage equity via the Crowdcube platform in 2013, in exchange for an 8% slice of the business. The full amount was secured in just 2 days, and was followed by a private investment of £380k, according to Crowdfundinsider. The platform had also forged an alliance with sendacow.org, which meant that for every £1,000 invested, Fruitful would purchase one dairy goat for an African family. So, should African families be worried? Fruitfulís redirection is a far cry from the shady goings-on that have recently been uncovered at Swedish peer-to-peer lending platform Trustbuddy. All signs point to the Fruitful platform surviving, only in a new guise. Fruitful will no longer serve as a retail investment instrument, but the platform appears to be working hard to ensure that all loose ends (pertaining to retail money) are tied off. We'll be keeping a close eye on how the situation unfolds.  Luke Barnes, CEO of Fruitful, offered us comment: ""Over the past 10 months, Fruitful have been in a soft-launch to a select number of lenders and borrowers. The purpose of the soft-launch was to test the product, see what customers wanted and gather data to see how we can grow a sustainable business. Once our ambitions collided with reality, we found that people lending their money wanted high-yielding (above market interest rates) and short term investments (easy access).  From our data, we could see that the frequency of customers investing their money and withdrawing would make it difficult for Fruitful to scale. And, ultimately, this type of investing wasnít a good fit for the long-term loans people were investing in. After thorough deliberation, we made the tough decision to stop accepting retail investments for the foreseeable future.  To that end, weíve made a pivot. Fruitful will continue to be a marketplace for borrowing and lending ó the thing thatís changing is the type of investor peers. Instead of individual retail investors, weíre partnering with a number of institutions who want long term and very low risk investments in residential mortgages.  So, although this represent a change in gears, weíre still behind our mission of democratising finance. Specifically in ways that puts money right back into the pockets of people that borrow with us ó so they can do more of what they love in their life.""

439;Founded in 2005, Zopa entered P2P lending when the sector was better known as a possible provider of micro-loans for the unbanked population of emerging markets rather than a viable alternative to banks in Western countries. At the time, thanks to falling global interest rates and accommodative lending practices from banks that eventually led to the 2008/09 global financial crisis (GFC), sourcing loans with attractive yields were fairly easy to come by in many parts of the world. Fast forward a few years, and the GFC has caused lenders to be more cautious of their practices which has shut out scores of borrowers from receiving loans from banks.For the P2P lending sector, this change in lending habits by banks and traditional lenders has allowed them to step in and become an alternative for sourcing loans. In addition, with yields remaining low, lending marketplaces provide investors an opportunity to gain greater returns on their cash than from similar fixed income securities.After participating in both the early years for P2P lending and its current rocket ship growth phase, Zopa announced today that they have achieved the £1 billion milestone for loans transacted on their platform. With the milestone, Zopa is the first UK P2P lender to reach the £1 billion mark.Speaking to the BBC today and reiterating remarks he said in the past, Giles Andrews, CEO and Co-Founder of Zopa, stated that more than providing loans to the unbanked, they are able to beat banks, with better terms being made available on their platform. According to Zopa, with their current growth, the firm now has a 2% share of the UK unsecured loan market.Zopaís march toward £1 billion has intensified over the past year and a half. After totaling £265 million in loans on their platform during 2014, they have surpassed that figure so far in 2015, and expect to reach above £550 million this year. Looking ahead, Zopa believes that by the end of 2016 they will achieve £2 billion in loans processed on their platform. .Other statistics revealed by Zopa today are that the £1 billion consisted of 61,000 lenders to 146,000 borrowers. Overall, the average lending rate was 5% with over £57 million in interest returned to lenders. Of the loans, Zopa reported that Car Loans composed 40% of the total, followed by Home Improvements and Debt Consolidation at 22% each.;social economy;http://www.financemagnates.com/fintech/p2p/zopa-hits-1-billion-in-p2p-lending-with-2-billion-goal-by-end-of-2016/

He noted that the company takes the credit out of the banking sphere, and puts it into an online lending marketplace, offering benefits to both customers and investors. Lendico has had over 250,000 users in the two years since it was founded, and has loaned over 1.3 billion euros to customers.

He said, ìWe welcome the regulation,î due to what heís seen in the countries that Lendico operates in: so-called black sheep that donít put in the adequate amount of tension or risk assessment. Steinkuehler is hopeful that implementing P2P regulations will raise standards, avoiding higher losses for the investor later on. In terms of regulation in general, Steinkuehler said they would welcome a unified regulatory scheme across Europe, because theyíve seen the UK moving ahead, regulation-wise, and strongly supporting marketplace lenders. whereas in countries such as Germany, the regulator hasnít really taken such a strong stance in support of the industry.Lendico LogoYou can understand Steinkuehlerís perspective particularly well when heís asked how many regulators the company has. With a patient smile, he says,Weíre active in seven countries, so weíre reporting to seven regulators, and every regulatory scheme in each country is different.Asked about the next step for Lendico, Steinkuehler says that he canít comment on all the strategies theyíre working onñbut that theyíre working on ìsome very neat solutionsî on the regulatory perspective.

441;Although hundreds of Chinese companies identify themselves as being peer-to-peer ó or P2P ó lending platforms, there is no single model that defines Chinese P2P.The reason? Borrowers are harder to vet, and lenders harder to please than elsewhere.In the US, P2P platforms can lean heavily on comprehensive records maintained by credit bureaus when vetting a borrower. But in a country where few consumers have ever had the opportunity to borrow, and small firms hide their true value from authorities as a matter of course, a more extensive credit review is needed.AdvertisementMeanwhile, lenders in China have been weaned in an environment where almost all investments come with an implicit state guarantee, instilling a low tolerance for losses, regardless of how small.Hereís a look at the different approaches three major Chinese P2P operators have taken:Yooli.comWhile in the U.S. P2P platforms mainly facilitate loans to consumers, in China a big part of the market is focused on getting credit to small firms.ìIn China, thereís just no other ways for certain companies to raise money,î says Liu Yannan, CEO and founder of Yooli.com.Yooli.com finds small firms that need a loan by working with dozens of small loan companies around the country.Regulations heavily constrain how much such firms can lend. But P2P allows them to provide credit to a bigger pool of customers, or continue serving existing customers when their needs grow.They find the borrower on behalf of the P2P platform, vet them, and ñ so that they bear responsibility for the recommendations they make ñ guarantee that they will repay what the lender is owed if the borrower defaults. In return, the small loan company gets roughly half of the interest rate paid by the borrower.Yooli is increasingly moving into consumer lending. They still find borrowers through third parties ñ like car dealerships ñ but they conduct the due diligence in house, and are willing to forego guarantees from third parties if the borrower seems like a good bet.Dianrong.comDianrong.com takes a different approach. It focuses on consumer lending, and it doesnít make guarantees, preferring that lenders become accustomed to minimizing their own risk by investing in multiple loans.Dianrong was set up by CEO Soul Htite, one of the founders of Lending China Corp., the U.S. P2P pioneer that raised $870 million in an initial public offering last year. He started building the China business early in 2011, and in March 2012 Dianrong made its first loan.Mr. Htite says that the vetting needed at Dianrong is significantly more extensive than in the U.S.ìChina has the largest credit bureau in the world, but because of shadow banking you donít know if youíre getting the whole picture,î said Mr. Htite.The process of vetting borrowers involves verifying that the person is who they say they are, assessing whether theyíre likely to repay, and analyzing bank statements to look for evidence of other loans ñ from small loan firms, credit guarantee companies, and even other P2P platforms ñ that donít submit data to the credit bureau.Dianrong is ìabout creating a way to operate the lending and borrowing business in a transparent way,î said Mr. Htite. ìItís about making the marketplace transparent.îChina Rapid FinanceChina Rapid Financeís plan is to find creditworthy borrowers among those who have never considered borrowing before.ìThe challenge for Chinaís P2P industry is: who can acquire a large number of borrowers at low cost and large scale and good credit quality,î said Zane Wang, the founder and CEO or China Rapid Finance.Mr. Wang has a PhD in statistics, and previously helped set up Shanghaiís credit bureau. CRF made its first P2P loan in 2010.CRF teamed up with internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd last year in an effort to identify Chinese consumers who didnít have a credit history but were likely to be worthy borrowers. Using data from Tencentís payments unit and publicly available data, including social media, CRF came up with a list of 50 million people that it was willing to pre-approve to borrow very small amounts.It has since started offering those people 500-yuan loans over its mobile platform. If they make repayments on time, they can borrow more. And if they prove reliable, they can apply for a larger loan still, at which point CRF will put them through a more rigorous vetting process. The company says that in the three months up to the end of April, it had made more than 1.1 million loans.ìWe want to move [people] up the credit ladder,î said Mr. Wang. ìThe borrowers appreciate it because itís the first time that someone has been willing to lend them money.î;social economy;http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2015/06/04/making-p2p-lending-work-in-china-whats-your-model/
442;Peer-to-peer lending originated as a niche alternative source of financing which used the internet to connect individuals, looking to borrow small amounts of money, with other individuals willing to lend them such funds. Over the last couple years however, attracted by the growing popularity and higher than average potential returns, big money investors have plowed tons of available borrowing dollars into the industry and have essentially muscled out most of the ìindividualî money lenders.  With this significant influx of capital the average size and availability of P2P loans has increased significantly over the last 3-5 years. As the popularity of P2P lending continues to grow in an almost juggernaut like manner, existing and new P2P lending platforms are branching out into other specialized lending markets and subsectors such as student loans, commercial lending, real-estate lending, and even franchise lending.Lending Club Successful IPOExactly when big money investors first started taking serious notice of the monstrious potential of the P2P lending industry is anyoneís guess. It is clear however that today, most likely fueled by the recent successful IPOs of two of the oldest P2P lending platforms LendingClub (NYSE: LC) and OnDeck (NYSE: ONDK)) last year, the investment race is on and big money investors are running to get in on the ground floor of just about anything P2P lending related. This is evident by the flurry of recently publicized direct and indirect investments made by big money investors. Some of the more notable of these recent transactions include the following (in order of announcement):ïLendKey (April 14, 2015) ñ LendKey is a P2P lending platform focused on providing new student loans and refinancing existing student loans.

What is certain is that this is only the beginning.Last year alone, more than $8.9 Billion in loans were made through P2P lending platforms and more than $1.32 Billion in venture capital money was invested in these platforms (see below). With these numbers it is no wonder why you are seeing such a flurry of big money investments in P2P lending platforms and related services. Moreover, given that the popularity (and number of) P2P platforms is growing exponentially, and the fact that most One Trillion Dollarsanalysts predict that the industry will grow to over $500 Billion in the next decade (with some pegging the number at $1 Trillion), this investment trend shows no signs of slowing in the foreseeable future.;social economy;http://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2015/04/66230-p2p-lending-platforms-big-money-investors-looking-for-piece-of-the-pie/
443;"For years now, big bank lenders have warned the public about the dangers of dealing with ìshadowî (i.e. non-bank) lending institutions. The term itself conjures up images of shady back-room deals where youíre handed money in a paper bag and told to pay it back in a week, ìor else!î To borrow a line from one of my favorite movies, the Usual Suspects, Shadow banking institutions ìhave become a myth, a spook story that banks tell their clients Ö leave us, and the shadow bankers will get you!î Ö However, with the astronomic recent rise of technology based, non-bank, lending alternatives such as peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, itís really the big banks that should be afraid Ö very afraid!Scary SpookThe term ìshadow bankingî was first coined by Paul McCulley, a former Pimco executive. It was originally used by McCulley to describe those non-bank lending institutions that played fast and loose with borrower qualifications and approved tons of easy-money financing for clearly unqualified borrowers. This of course led to the subprime mortgage market crash and subsequent financial crisis. As a result, itís no wonder why this term carries such a dark connotation (get it Ö dark Ö shadow). Today the use of this term has broadened considerably and is often used to describe just about all non-bank lending institutions including: investment banks; structured investment vehicles; insurance companies; institutional investors; hedge funds; mutual funds; money market funds; P.E. funds;  crowdfunding and, of course, P2P lending.  The problem is that transparent models like P2P lending platforms do not operate in the ìshadowî at all.Aaron VermutAs Aaron Vermut, CEO of Prosper Marketplace (one of the largest P2P lending platforms), told CNBC in a recent interview: ìWe donít consider ourselves to be quote, unquote, ëshadowí anything. ÖOne of the things thatís unique about what weíre doing is weíre very, very transparent about what weíre doing, which is unusual in banking and lending.î Unusual is an understatement. The level of transparency present in the majority of P2P lending deals is unprecedented in the banking industry. For example, did you know that Prosper and LendingClub (the two largest P2P Lending platforms) offer over 200 data points for an investor to consider, including borrowerís: FICO scores; employment; income; etc. Moreover, with the use of the internet, any change or updates to such information can be readily incorporated into pricing calculations; something traditional banks have been unable or unwilling to do.Letís be clear, the real cause of the financial crisis was a lack of transparency not a lack of regulation. Itís absolutely true that certain non-regulated mortgage brokers/lending institutions contributed heavily to the market crash but they absolutely werenít alone. Who do you think was buying and helping to sell the junk mortgage backed securities? Ö You guessed it, regulated banks (for a fantastic and hilarious visual summary of the Subprime mortgage crisis see ìThe Subprime Primerî). So, the fact that current P2P lending platforms and other fintech (i.e. internet based financial technologies) solutions are not regulated in the same manner that banks are does not necessarily make them something to be feared. In fact, all evidence points to the fact that borrowers and investors alike are flocking to these fintech platforms in droves due to their un-paralleled transparency and ease of use (among other things).Beyond the improved transparency, there are several other factors that are making P2P lending and other fintech platforms more attractive to borrowers (and investors) than traditional banks:ïAvailability of Funds. Due to post-crisis concerns and increased regulation, the availability of traditional bank loans has shrunk considerably. Particularly for projects such as infrastructure improvements and speculative real estate construction/renovation, and/or for borrowers with a few ìbadî post-crisis income years. With this growing gap in funding, institutional investors, P2P lending platforms and other non-traditional ìshadowî institutions have stepped up to meet the capital needs of borrowers.ïBetter rates. For those Borrowers that can actually get traditional bank loans, they are still more likely to find better rates by going through a P2P or other non-bank lender. Lending is a significantly expensive activity for traditional banks due to the regulatory hurdles and vast amounts of overhead banks are subject to. These costs have been traditionally passed through to borrowers in terms of higher interest rates. P2P lending and other fintech platforms on the other hand, are not subject to the same regulatory issues that banks are (as they donít take deposits) and thus donít face the same inflated compliance costs. Moreover, the increased use of technology by fintech companies, coupled with lean company profiles, significantly decreases the general amount of overhead costs for these companies. The resulting savings are passed through to the borrowers in the form of lower average interest rates. Not to mention the increased investment return potential it creates for investors. As an example, please see the chart below illustrating a comparison of Lending Clubís interest rate breakdown by component vs. traditional banking";social economy;http://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2015/05/68355-peer-to-peer-lending-taking-the-fear-out-of-shadow-banking/

Just as recent bans on ""small-amount loans"" have been sidestepped by pay-day lenders with longer-term loans for larger amounts, he claimed the real loan sharks have switched to business loans to sole traders.MoneyMe lends at rates of 12 to 24 per cent over four week periods, which equates to annualised rates of 180 per cent.""There is zero regulation there,"" he said. ""They are charging [huge] interest rates and the poor small-business operator doesn't have another avenue. It is exploiting the sole trader and the risk is an unknown quantum.""Numerous new SME lenders say they lend responsibly, but voice similar concerns. Their sector has seen a sudden influx of lenders typically offering unsecured loans to companies with turnover below $100,000. Interest rates start at credit card rates of about 15-20 per cent but go much higher. The main problem, however, appears to be a lack of standards that all must comply with.""There is not much regulation of business lending,"" said John de Bree, managing director of Capify, one of the oldest of the business lenders. It started in the United States in 2002. It offers merchant cash advances and straight business loans.Other new small-business lenders have privately pointed the finger at Capify, which was known as Ausvance in Australia until July, as well as its chief competitor Prospa Advance (now just Prospa), arguing their model results in effective annual interest rates well above 30 per cent.Mr de Bree wants regulation because he has seen competitors lending far more to risky borrowers than Capify thinks is safe. ""For the consumer there is ACCC, APRA, ASIC. On our side of the fence we have a flood of new entrants ñ where's the regulation, where's the tried and tested credit model?,"" he said. Mr de Bree said there needs to be at least a ""no-stacking"" rule imposed by the industry itself. This means that if a borrower already has a loan, they cannot get another. Stuart Stoyan, the chief of new Australian peer-to-peer lender MoneyPlace, has similar worries about recently listed online lender DirectMoney, which claimed it would be the first Australian P2P lender to float before its listing on July 13.Apart from arguing DirectMoney is not a P2P lender because it does not operate a lending ""marketplace"", with individuals lending directly to borrowers, MoneyPlace and rival RateSetter say the controversy surrounding the float and its performance since then threaten confidence in P2P. After a brief spike, DirectMoney was trading at 14¢ on Friday, 20 per cent lower than its 20¢ offer price.It revised its prospectus because ASIC said it was unclear shareholders would be liable for defaults in the first 30 days of a loan. It also revealed losses due to fraud.Read more: http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/sme-and-p2p-lending-startups-scared-of-a-trust-bust-20150814-gizj19.html#ixzz3qLJVOTzC Follow us: @smh on Twitter | sydneymorningherald on Facebook";social economy;http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/sme-and-p2p-lending-startups-scared-of-a-trust-bust-20150814-gizj19.html

446;Kabbage, a US lending company based in Atlanta, has raised £135 million in equity from a group of investors that include ING, Santander and Scotiabank.Other backers include Chinaís Yuan Capital and Japanese firm Recruit Strategic Partners, as well as existing investors from earlier funding rounds.The fresh investment, led by Reverence Capital Partners, will give Kabbage, which deals mainly with SMEs, the chance to collaborate with the major banking investors.According to chief executive Rob Frohwein, Kabbage can provide the banks with ëan elegant technical solutioní for consumer and small business lending. The company, he says, is expected to reach $1 billion in originated loans this year.Kabbageís PatchKabbage delivers a verdict on its loans in six minutes, granting up to $100,000 in credit lines to new businesses. The firm is supported by investment company Guggenheim Securities.Mariano Belinky, managing partner at Santander InnoVentures, told IBS Intelligence: ëKabbage is one of the leading companies in the lending space. The platform is critical for scaling and powerful lending.íCommercial collaborations are a distant thought, however. At the stage, Belinky says, the two companies are not discussing the future.With its new funding Kabbage intends to licence its technology to banks and other financial institutions, as well as expand internationally. Its main target in 2016 will be Latin America.The lending company has raised over $240 million in equity funding so far, plus an extra $360 million in debt financing.;social economy;https://ibsintelligence.com/lending-platform-kabbage-raises-135m-from-major-banking-backers/
447;"Kabbage ó the online platform that loans money to businesses and individuals using a wide set of online data and algorithms to measure credit-worthiness ó is growing once more. The startup based out of Atlanta has raised a Series E of $135 million, and expanded its credit facility ó the money it has on hand to fulfil loans ó to $900 million.Kabbage is not officially disclosing its valuation but from close sources we understand it now to have reached the billion-dollar mark.Rob Frohwein, Kabbageís founder and CEO, said in an interview that the investment will be used to expand the companyís business deeper into consumer lending, as well as internationally. Its consumer Karrot platform was launched last year to complement Kabbageís primary loans business focused on online merchants and other SMBs.ìWeíre at the precipice of a large expansion of Karrot,î Frohwein says. Today it represents 10 percent of our business and will be between 25 percent and 30 percent of our business by next year.îThe Series E comes from a list of both financial and strategic investors ó which, in the case of a financial tech startup can often be one and the same. The round was led by Reverence Capital Partners, a regular investor in finance businesses; with participation also from several of the worldís biggest banks: Hollandís ING, Spainís Santander (via InnoVentures); and Canadaís Scotiabank.The fact that the investor list has so many international banks is significant for Kabbageís future business: the company is going to use its funding to take its platform to several new markets in Europe and elsewhere, in partnership with its new backers. First up will be a product in Spain, aimed first at businesses and then individual borrowers, with further launches planned across Europe a month from now.Itís also a sign of how Kabbage ó as well as other financial tech startups like Kreditech (which itself recently raised a big round), Lending Club and Prosper ó have been adept in leveraging advances in big data analytics, social media and e-commerce to steal a march on incumbent lenders ó that is, traditional banks ó offering loans on more favorable terms and often with lower bad debt rates.Now the banks are sitting up and taking notice and hoping to tap into what these startups have built, rather than trying directly to replicate it themselves.ìKabbage is one of the leading companies in the lending space, having built their technology & data platform from the ground up before they even launched to customers. Their method of using real data in the loan approval process, rather than relying solely on credit scores, is unique and innovative,î Mariano Belinky, managing partner at Santander InnoVentures, told TechCrunch. ìWith the company rapidly growing and with improved operating efficiency, our investment also makes sense from a financial standpoint. With full automation of the platform, the company doesnít have to spend as much in marketing, headcount and other operating costs to scale their business.îThis growth ó taking Kabbage well beyond its core market of the U.S., and pushing much further into its newer personal loan product ó is part of the reason why the company expanded its credit facility so much. Before todayís announcement it was only around $260 million, Rob Frohwein, Kabbageís founder Many founders and investors have talked about how the going is good right now for fast-growing startups to raise funding, and thatís been the case here for Kabbage as well.ìWhy $135 million?î Frohwein repeated when I asked him about the funding. ìItís not a lucky number or anything. We actually set out to raise between $75 million and $80 million, but there was a huge amount of interest. And, during the funding process, we started to get more opportunities to partner with banks to build the international business. That opens up a lot of complexity so it made sense to raise more money now.îGoing forward, the large equity raise will also mean that Kabbage itself will start to participate more directly in the credit facility and loans portion of the business.Moving beyond being solely a platform provider to arrange the loans is a sign of how Kabbage ìhas skin in the game,î says Frohwein.But it also gives the company a stronger vertical position (and better margins) going forward. To date, the companyís biggest revenue drivers have been around taking a percentage interest on the loans completed on its platform, as well as through licensing fees. Kabbage offers its tech as a white-label platform in Australia, for example, and there are plans to ramp up those kinds of partnerships significantly in the future. The company is on track for $100 million in revenues this year, the CEO tells me.Notably, the $900 million credit facility expansion getting announced today comes from a completely different mixture of banks and other financial groups, and no overlap with Kabbageís equity investors, he tells me. Frohwein adds that the companyís underwriting performance has been ìsteadily improvingî over the years. When the company started putting out capital in 2011, it was lending $7 million a year. ìNow we do that in just over a day,î he says.As part of the deal, Milton Berlinski, managing partner of Reverence Capital Partners, is joining Kabbageís board of directors.";social economy;http://techcrunch.com/2015/10/14/kabbage-loans-unicorn/

449;If youíre tired of fixed rate investments that pay next to nothing, you may find salvation in the growing peer-to-peer lending (P2P) market. This type of investment comes with more risks than with those youíll find elsewhere, but thereís potential for greater earnings as well. Before taking the plunge, however, itís important to understand how it works and the risks youíll confront.How P2P Investing WorksP2P platforms are called ìpeer to peerî because they bring regular people ñ peers ñ together to participate in two sides of the same transaction. While borrowers turn to P2P lending in order to apply for a loan, investors show up in order to secure higher than average returns on their investment capital.Since there is generally no middle man involved in these transactions, fees are usually lower. Meanwhile, interest rates available to borrowers are often lower than rates offered by traditional banks as well. And to an even more extreme degree, the interest rates P2P investors earn on their money can be considerably higher than what they might earn by putting their money in a certificate of deposit or money market account.   For example, Lending Clubís advertised rates range from 5.19% all the way up to 32.99%. No matter who you bank with, this is dramatically higher than what you can get even on a long-term certificate of deposit.This isnít to say that banks are totally absent from the process. A P2P platform may use a bank as the servicing agent to administer each loan. But since the role of each bank is limited, the fees paid out to them only average around 1 percent per year.If you choose to invest in a peer-to-peer lending platform, you will most likely invest in a series of ìnotes.î These notes represent small slivers of various loans, with some denominations as small as $25. Using this method, P2P lending sites allow you to spread a relatively small investment across many different loans. For example, a $10,000 investment can be spread across 400 notes of $25 each.In order to become an investor on a P2P platform, you need to meet certain criteria. On some sites, you need to be an accredited investor, which means you must meet certain stiff income or net worth requirements. On others, you must meet your state requirements, which typically include earning a minimum income of $70,000 per year and/or having a minimum net worth of $250,000.Popular P2P Investing PlatformsThere are a growing number of P2P platforms that welcome investors. Three of the most popular include Lending Club, Prosper, and SoFi. All three are multibillion-dollar lending platforms, although each offers slightly different terms and requirements for investors.   In addition, some lenders in the P2P realm focus mainly on certain types of loans. For example, Lending Club and Prosper will make loans for just about any purpose, while SoFi favors student loan refinances and consolidations (although it offers personal loans as well). Other P2P lenders may focus on small business loans or almost any other niche you can imagine.On most P2P platforms, loans are funded by both private individuals and institutional investors. Some P2P platforms will even allow you to a hold your investments in an individual retirement account (IRA). Meanwhile, it is possible to get double-digit returns on your money by investing in lower grade notes, which naturally carry a higher risk.There is one very significant point to note before investing on any P2P platform ñ the loans that you are investing in are self-amortizing. That means that the value of your investment will gradually move towards zero as each payment is made.Unlike CDs and bonds where you put up a fixed amount of money and collect your interest over the term of the security, P2P loans change in value over time. With P2P investments, you are investing in loans that are comprised of both principal and interest. In other words, youíll earn most of your interest upfront, while receiving most of the principal back towards the end of the loanís term.For that reason, you must continually reinvest the payments that you receive into new notes. That will ensure that your money is fully invested, which will help you earn the rate of interest you expect.Higher Rates of Return on Fixed Rate InvestmentsAs noted earlier, you can easily earn double-digit interest rate returns on P2P investments ñ which is clearly the main attraction of P2P lending platforms. Generally, this is accomplished by including higher risk loans in your portfolio.For example, Prosper grades itís loans from ìAAî (highest) to ìHRî (lowest, or ìhigher riskî). AA loans pay an average of 5.48%, while HR loans pay an average of 10.78%. By investing primarily in HR loans, you can earn double-digit returns on your money.ÖBut With Higher RiskThere are four critical factors you need to understand when investing through P2P sites:1.P2P borrows can default, in which case you can lose money.2.The higher the rate of return on a loan, the greater the likelihood of default.3.There is no FDIC insurance coverage to protect your investment as would be the case if you held your money in a bank.4.The P2P site may require you to cover certain collection costs in the event that a loan goes into default.Another factor to consider is that P2P platforms donít underwrite loans according to strict bank standards. For example, SoFi will make a loan to a recent college graduate on the basis of a promise of employment, rather than an actual job.If you are going to favor high risk/high return investments, you need to be aware of exactly what you are investing in. It is possible that because of loan default rates, your the higher returns could be cancelled out. It is also worth considering that P2P lending is a relatively recent phenomenon, and how the loans will perform in a recession is not entirely certain.So Is P2P Investing a Good Idea?Investing through a P2P platform can work well if you understand the risks you are taking. With that being said, the approach is to use P2P investments to supplement the fixed income portion of your investment portfolio. Letís say you are holding 30% of your portfolio in interest-bearing investments of varying maturities and earning around 3%. By investing 20% of your fixed income allocation in P2P loans that earn an average of 6%, you can increase the overall rate of return on your fixed income allocation from 3% to 3.6%.Meanwhile, you should probably steer clear of investing all of your fixed income allocation into P2P loans. By doing so, you may be taking on an excessive level of risk. Lending Club recognizes this fact, and recommends that you limit your investment in their notes to not more than 10% of your net worth. Thatís good advice.Getting the Most Out of P2P Investing ñ For the Lowest RiskSome strategies can help you reduce the risks involved in peer-to-peer investing. Here are some to consider:_Diversify your holdings across many different notes, so that a default on any one of them will not be a disaster_Favor loans with higher credit scores_Favor loans with lower debt-to-income (DTI) ratios_Favor debt consolidation loans over purchase money loans (loans that lower a borrowerís monthly payment are less risky than those that increase it)_Favor loans where the borrower has greater employment stabilityIf youíre aware of the risks involved in P2P investing ñ and you know how to at least partially mitigate them ñ then P2P investments can be a welcome addition to your portfolio.;social economy;http://www.doughroller.net/p2p-lending/is-p2p-lending-a-good-investment/
450;First, disco bit the dust. Then, punk rock keeled over. Now, peer-to-peer lending has been annihilated. Who murdered P2P? Wall Street. BlackRock. Wealthy bankers. The guys I was shoulder-to-shoulder with last week in Las Vegas. At ABS Vegas 2015, billed as the largest capital markets conference in the world, the P2P/Online Lending 101 session attracted a Standing Room Only crowd. However, this crowd was not made up of peers. These were killers.Often called P2PL, this contemporary lending mechanism entails lending money directly between investors and borrowers, without using a traditional financial institution. Like eBay, Airbnb, Uber and other peer-to-peer services, P2PL represents an efficient take on a longtime business. In the U.S., the leaders in P2PL have been Prosper and Lending Club. These are platforms where customers, looking for lower-interest loans than they can secure through a bank or by using their credit cards, are paired up with investors who want a solid, steady return. At Lending Club, the larger of the two leading firms with about $4 billion in loans in 2014, a borrower with good credit history and stable income can get a loan for as little as $1,000 and as much as $35,000. Both borrower and lender pay Lending Club a fee, and the interest that the borrower pays goes to the lender. The online architecture of P2PL platforms reduces the cost of lending dramatically from what bricks-and-mortar banks have to spend, enhancing the returns on these loans. P2PL is a 21st-Century phenomenon. It started in 2005 in the United Kingdom, with a company called Zopa, and the next year in the US with Prosper and Lending Club. Just six years later, those two US firms had reportedly serviced 180,000 loans, for a total value of $2 billion.Not surprisingly, those big numbers drew the attention of Wall Street. While P2PL initially attracted ordinary citizens to invest in modestly sized consumer loans to people like them, over the last few years those peer investors often have been elbowed out and replaced by Wall Street's finest. Last summer, Blue Elephant Capital Management said it would invest more than $300 million in loans through peer-to-peer platforms. BlackRock Inc., the world's largest asset manager, has amassed $330 million of Prosper loans, which amounted to about one-sixth of the loans Prosper had made between late 2013 and early 2015, according to Bloomberg Business. These are just two among many Wall Street-style firms looking to get a piece of P2PL's above-market returns.I was there in that expo hall at ABS last week. As I looked around, this was not a crowd of small-time peer investors. These were Wall Street bankers, lured by the attractive P2PL returns. Why was I there? I wanted to befriend the executioners. As the P2PL sector gets overly crowded, I want these assassins to help homeowners avoid foreclosure. My firm, American Homeowner Preservation, crowdfunds the purchase of non-performing mortgages from big banks. These pools of loans are acquired at big discounts. This empowers AHP to deliver sustainable solutions to struggling families and keep them in their homes. To date, AHP has been supported primarily by peer investors. We need larger investors to help more families stay in their homes. We need institutional capital. ;social economy;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jorge-newbery/p2p-lending-is-dead_b_6705154.html

That CEO and Founder of P2P platform ThinCats Kevin Caley in FTAdvisor commented on the fact that the FCA still classifies P2P loans as non-standard investments currently made it difficult to recommend them.The FT noted that updates including a summer budget announcement of a new Innovative Finance ISA and a consultation on the various standard and non-standard asset classes that can be held within a SIPP from the FCA, are well-welcomed, long-awaited innovations:ìThe risk profile is pretty low versus return potential, I think consumers are being held back by having to pay extra to go into things like peer-to-peer,î Williams commented to the FT.Next steps for Ratesetter?

We have put in place funds for seed financing for up to 6 more DApps over the next 12 months and are now directly building relationships with open innovation teams within large consultancies to look at how we can scale working with, not against, incumbentsí.ëBecause weíre working cross-vendor, are stack agnostic, and not limiting ourselves solely to the financial services sector we believe we have hedged what is a risky bet to invest in the blockchain DApp space at this moment in time. We do this with the confidence of knowing that even if few startups in themselves become viable businesses, for any number of reasons, we at least ensure the learning-from-doing is preserved in BlockStars.io and can be monetised in any number of ways as the blockchain space takes offí.ëWhilst everyone talks about the disruptive powers of blockchains, and they very much have the potential to disrupt even the disrupters, we believe theyíre more a platform for collaborative, perhaps more reformative, innovation with established industries and incumbentsí.Founder Aron van Ammers says: ""We see vast possibilities in the paradigm that blockchains offer to create more open, trusted and verifiable systems to collaborate. Blockchains give us the ability to audit the world.""""The MoneyCircles.com POC demonstrates how smart contracts on a blockchain can add value to a financial application, with centralised and decentralised components each having their merits. We have gained great insights while building it, which we are excited to apply in the further development of MoneyCircles.com and other proof of concepts in the near future.""DApp business development processOutlier Ventures model is to validate and quantify a market opportunity for a DApp with seasoned experts from that given industry then prove itís technically possible through a POC. If it works we then put in a place a senior management team of experts from that space and either lead a further round of angel funding or put its team through a related accelerator.

454;Yesterday, the FCA was subjected to the scrutiny of members of the Treasury Select Committee at Portcullis House in Westminster. As part of a broader review of the entire operations of the FCA, Tracey McDermott (acting Chief Executive of the FCA) and John Griffith-Jones (Chairman of the FCA) were grilled by the Committee for a full 90 minutes, with some eight minutes of the session dedicated to the subject of peer-to-peer lending and equity crowdfunding. Chris Philp (MP for Croydon South) spearheaded the alternative finance-related questioning.Mr. Philp set the tone of his inquiry by first noting the rapid growth of the peer-to-peer sector, before then stating:ìIt is likely to continue growing quickly, and Iím concerned that it might be the next big regulatory or financial services scandal.îAuthorisation within the P2P SpacePhilp was especially intrigued by the ongoing process of full authorisation within the peer-to-peer space. McDermott clarified for the Committee that there are currently 56 peer-to-peer lenders and 35 ìinvestment based crowdfundersî (equity crowdfunders) that are either already authorised or that are currently going through the authorisation process. She didnít offer exact numbers for withdrawals or refusals, but recent research from Bovill would suggest that as many as 30 peer-to-peer lending applications have been withdrawn in recent months. McDermott made the point, however, that withdrawals are not permanent ñ with some companies withdrawing only in order to tinker with their application before reapplying.Mr. Philp was keen to understand exactly how the FCA is due diligencing applicants, asking specifically whether the regulator has been digging into the credit assessment abilities of the various lending platforms. McDermott replied that the FCA first assesses the business model, and how a companyís plans for making money stacks up against their plans for protecting investor money. She said that the credit processes of established platforms will be analysed, but that many applicants are startups that have little or nothing in the way of lending history to assess.Broader ConcernsMr. Philp had a number of broader concerns, beyond the matter of full authorisation. He requested of McDermott statistics on loss rates for those investing via P2P in the UK to date, to which she offered an answer of ìaround one percentî. Philp questioned whether so low a figure was ìtoo good to be trueî. ìIndeed!î replied McDermott, but she did issue the caveat that the FCA is seeing some lenders moving down the credit spectrum and that she expects loss rates to increase. Our colleagues at AltFi Data inform us that representing the default performance of the industry in one number is not possible given how quickly the industry is growing. The one percent loss rate also looks a little low.Philp then rounded onto the issue of maturity, suggesting that the vast majority of the loans originated by peer-to-peer lenders have yet to even near maturation, and that any representation of loss rates is therefore bound to be artificially low. Our answer? The UKís ìbig threeî P2P platforms ñ Zopa, RateSetter and Funding Circle ñ have each been around for at least five years (Zopa for more than a decade). Individual lenders may freely peruse the bad debt rates of each platform for every year that theyíve been lending. The historical returns of these platforms are calculated and published in the Liberum AltFi Returns Index, allowing investors to observe the return history of the sector for the past nine years. And these three platforms comprise 60.8% of the UKís peer-to-peer lending space, according to the Liberum AltFi Volume Index UK. It also appeared that the committee was under the impression that peer-to-peer loans are bullet loans, paying back all principal at the end of the loan term. This is not the case, with bullet or interest-only loans in fact making up only a small portion of P2P lending in the UK.McDermott readily admitted that there is a lack of performance data available for the equity crowdfunding sector at present. She stated that the FCA has thus required operators to be abundantly clear, through the medium of risk warnings, that the majority of startups fail. On the mechanics of peer-to-peer lending, Mr. Philp offered the following:ìWhen people invest in these crowdfunding platforms, like Zopa or others, there is probably some sense that theyíre in some way investing with the institution, and they may have the benefit of a portfolio effect. Of course, that is typically with peer-to-peer lending not the case. Theyíre effectively facilitating bilateral loans between Mrs. Smith in Brighton and whoever the end borrower is, and if that one end borrower happens to default then Mrs. Smith in Brighton will suffer a loss. There will be no pooling effect ñ which you would have in a bank or in a fund. Do consumers properly understand that they are taking one-to-one, bilateral, counterparty risk?îIn response, McDermott correctly pointed out that, in fact, investors will typically hold multiple exposures within peer-to-peer lending portfolios. However, it is true that the onus to diversify funds occasionally sits with the investor in peer-to-peer, depending on the platform in question. On Funding Circle, for instance, investors may choose the businesses that they wish to lend to. The platform recommends that investors spread their risk across at least 100 individual loans, but they are not forced to. McDermott admitted that itís very important for customers to understand such subtleties, but that it is perhaps too early at this stage to gauge the quality of their understanding. She also declared that the FCA has worked hard to make crystal clear the fact that investing via peer-to-peer platforms is not the same as placing money in a deposit account with a bank.Taking ActionMr. Philp suggested a range of requirements that might (or perhaps ought to) be imposed upon peer-to-peer lenders. He called the £20k reserve capital requirement ñ a staple of full authorisation ñ a ìlaughably small amount of money, given the scale of their [peer-to-peer lending platforms] operationsî. Mr. Philp asked whether platforms should be required to establish a ìsinking fundî ñ into which a portion of profits should be allocated each year, to act as a form of contingency protection for a platformís investors. McDermott pointed out that a fair number of peer-to-peer lenders already employ a ìprovision fundî ñ not dissimilar to the model described by Mr. Philp ñ but the Croydon South MP dismissed the comment, suggesting that these probably existed for ìmarketing purposesî. McDermott also noted that what was being proposed by Mr. Philp sounded a little bit like the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), and that the FCAís position is that the fundamental ìriskinessî of peer-to-peer lending means that the sector is not suitable for inclusion within the FSCS. John Griffith-Jones stepped in towards the end of the exchange (no doubt he had been internally debating whether or not to do so throughout the sessionÖ) to discuss the matter of intervention. He perceives a transition within the peer-to-peer lending space, with the platforms beginning to offer ìpackagesî to investors, rather than direct loan contracts. ìAt that point,î said the FCA Chairman, ìthey become awfully like a bank, and I think it is very important for the regulator not to allow regulatory arbitrage into the system. What I can assure you is that we are not asleep at this wheel. What I canít assure you of is when is the right moment to intervene.îIt must be remembered that peer-to-peer lenders lobbied for and welcomed regulation ñ something that is not often seen in a nascent financial sector. The sector has enjoyed a fairly light touch approach from the regulator to date, as LendInvest boss Christian Faes recently asserted. However, Griffith-Jonesí comments are fair warning indeed. In his keynote speech at LendIt Europe earlier this week, Funding Circle CEO Samir Desai cautioned against over-complicating the peer-to-peer business model. Desai honed in on maturity transformation ñ the practice of using shorter dated investor funds to satisfy longer dated loans. This maturity mismatch is an area that has traditionally been the reserve of the banks ñ one that has caused them significant trouble in the past (see, for example, Northern Rock). Could this be the sort of thing that Griffith-Jones had in mind when commenting on intervention?- See more at: http://www.equities.com/editors-desk/crowd-investing/crowdfunding/will-the-next-major-financial-scandal-come-from-p2p-lending#sthash.vYGMxVyS.dpuf;social economy;http://www.equities.com/editors-desk/crowd-investing/crowdfunding/will-the-next-major-financial-scandal-come-from-p2p-lending
455;Time to make way for another startup juggernaut out of the financial world. Funding Circle ó a London-based peer-to-peer platform for small businesses to get loans, and investors to put up money to finance those loans ó is today announcing that it has raised $150 million in venture funding, in a round that we have confirmed values the startup at over $1 billion.While partial news of the financing leaked out earlier this month, now we have the full details. This latest round was led by DST Global, with participation also from Baillie Gifford, a fund managed by BlackRock, Sands Capital Ventures and Singaporeís Temasek.ìWe are delighted to support Samir and the team at Funding Circle as they continue to grow and deliver value to both sides of their marketplace,î said Yuri Milner, founder of DST Global in a statement. DST has backed a wide range of other huge Internet companies and those that look like they are on their way to being huge. Recent other investments include Slack, Ola and Farfetch (enterprise collaboration, transport, and fashion respectively). Further back, it also invested in Twitter, Airbnb, Spotify and Facebook.While the companyís valuation vaults it into the so-called ìunicornî club, itís about to pass another billion landmark: Funding Circle is on target to loan out $1 billion on its platform this calendar year.Additionally, itís announcing some key appointments to bolster its growth. David Yu, formerly the CEO and CTO of online betting business Betfair, is Funding Circleís new chief product officer. It has also appointed Chitra Nayak, previously COO of Salesforceís Platform business, as its U.S. COO.Samir Desai, the co-founder and CEO of Funding Circle, tells me that the company was not actively looking to raise the money and doesnít even actually need it at the moment (sound familiar?). Of the $65 million it raised last summer, the ìvast majority is still on the balance sheet,î he said in an interview.Still, there are plans for where investments will be made. The company is currently active in the U.S. and UK markets, and it has plans to expand to further countries later this year. (Where that will be Desai is not yet making public, but the involvement of DST and Temasek could mean a move into Asia, if not deeper into Europe.) And even considering the volumes of transactions Funding Circle is already seeing in markets where it already exists, there is a lot of room to grow.ìIn the UK where weíve lent over £600 million the amount of awareness among small businesses is still low,î he said. ìLess than 5% of businesses have heard of us, and the proportion is even less in the U.S.î So part of the investment the company will make going forward will be in marketing ìto drive more users to our services,î he said. There are a number of other online lending platforms in the market today ó Lending Club, Prosper, Zopa and Smava (which raised money today too) being a just a handful of the others out there working specifically in the area of P2P loans. But itís because of this low awareness that Desai thinks the big competition for Funding Circle remains to be more traditional banks, which still account for most of the loans that small businesses get today. Launched in 2010, Desai says that Funding Circle currently has around 40,000 investors putting money up for loans on its platform, with lenders ranging from individuals through to large institutions like the UK government. While some lending platforms have scandalously nosedived because they could never manage to recoup the money given out, Funding Circle has built a business that is providing decent returns both to the company itself and to the people who are investing in it.Desai says that about 2% of Funding Circleís loans ìgo badî each year, but overall investors are seeing returns of 7% on their investments in the UK, and 10% in the U.S. Interest rates are not drastically different from what a customer might see from a bank loan ó anything from 6% to 20% Desai says ó but the key difference is simply that the business may get the money using Funding Circle, when it might not be so lucky with the bank.Funding Circle makes income by taking between 2% and 5% from the borrower, and 1% per year from lenders, largely for a servicing fee.It also has constructed its business to focus on a very particular type of small business. Desai describes a typical loan applicant a a ìmain street businessî ó restaurants or pharmacies or small manufacturing operations ó which have been trading for eight years on average, with revenues of over $1 million annually.These companies have in the past struggled to access credit, he says, which they would need for one-off investments like capital projects. ìOnce a business borrows from us there is a 77% chance it will come back.îStill, the promise of Funding Circle as a money-making business is one that seems still in the future. According to numbers published by The Times, the companyís last full-year accounts show that it made revenues of £5.3 million ($8 million) in 2013, up from £1.9 million in 2012. It also made a pre-tax loss of £5.3 million in 2013.This is one of the largest funding rounds for a startup out of London, and for a lending platform anywhere. Other notable fintech fundings out of Europe include WorldRemit, which picked up $100 million in February, $58 million for TransferWise, and Kreditechís $40 million.Funding Circle has now raised $273 million to date, with other investors including Index Ventures, Accel Partners, Union Square Ventures and Ribbit Capital.;social economy;http://techcrunch.com/2015/04/22/p2p-lending-site-funding-circle-raises-150m-led-by-dst-at-a-1b-valuation/
456;"Though peer-to-peer lending was pioneered in the US by companies such as LendingClub, China is where it's really taking off.Internet-based peer lenders there gave out at least $US32.5 billion ($42.3 billion) in loans last year, almost quadruple the rest of the world combined, according to UK investment bank Liberum Capital. It predicts lending in China will almost double this year to $US60 billion versus $US11.7 billion in the US, the second-largest market. In peer-to-peer lending, companies use the Internet to quickly match borrowers and lenders at better rates than banks.The outsized growth is attracting big-name investors from Tiger Global Management to Alibaba Group Holding. And it's testing a state-dominated banking system that's traditionally favoured big government firms at the expense of smaller players.Soul Htite, the LendingClub co-founder who left to form Chinese lender Dianrong.com about three years ago, said he believes the momentum is just getting started.  ""The market in China is more profitable because costs are lower and the growth is much bigger,"" the 42-year-old entrepreneur said in an interview.Dianrong, which bundles funds from investors and lends them to smaller businesses hungry for capital, hopes to lead China's new crop of peer-lending services. It has facilitated about 1 billion yuan ($209 million) of mostly business loans, charging lower rates than the shadow banks that private businesses turn to when shut out of cheaper mainstream credit.""Shadow banking interest rates can go up to 50 per cent -- that's unfair,"" Htite said in a May 29 interview in Hong Kong. ""There are people who are good risks at 12, 11 or 5 per cent.""For Chinese investors, P2P lending offers higher interest rates than they'd get leaving their money in the bank, with the promise of lower risk than putting their money in China's volatile stock market. Lenders claim they lower the risks of default by spreading the cash across a large number of loans.     The pace of growth has drawn regulatory scrutiny: Chinese officials are considering what rules are needed to maintain oversight of the sector. Deputy central bank governor Pan Gongsheng warned in November that most Internet financial companies were ""not well-versed"" in risk management.Htite welcomes that scrutiny because he says it will bring more clarity and confidence. He adds that while his model bundles loans, each lender effectively signs mini contracts with each borrower, insuring greater transparency.Dianrong is looking to expand by partnering with banks and companies, including EBay Inc., to offer loans and other financial services and expand overseas.The startup plans to lend money to Chinese businesses that sell goods to US customers on EBay, Htite said.  The tie-up is still in a trial phase. Loans will be offered to a group of sellers to fund expansion plans such as building warehouses, Daniel Feiler, a spokesman for EBay, said Tuesday without elaborating.""They're looking to shortcut around Wal-Mart,"" Htite said. Wal-Mart Stores, the world's largest retail chain, is one of the biggest US importers of Chinese goods.China's nascent online financing arena isn't without risk. It's already crowded with more than 1,500 lenders -- not all sound. According to Yingcan Group, which tracks the data, 275 lenders went bankrupt or had trouble repaying money last year, prompting regulators to take a closer look at the sector.Yet the prospects of faster growth and higher returns are luring investment.  Tiger Global, the US investment firm run by Chase Coleman, bought an undisclosed stake in Dianrong this year. Tencent Holdings, Asia's second-biggest Internet company and owner of the WeChat messaging service, and an affiliate of e-commerce provider Alibaba have stepped into the fray.In total, 24 peer-to-peer firms have received 3 billion yuan of financing from companies -- including SoftBank  , Sequoia Capital and Xiaomi   -- as of September, according to Zero2IPO Group, an industry tracker.Even traditional banks are testing the waters.Dianrong built an Internet financing business for Bank of Suzhou in Jiangsu province, taking a percentage of profits from that operation, Htite said. The company is currently building similar platforms for four more banks, he said.Dianrong's future plans include tapping capital from US lenders.""We want to bring US capital to China,"" Htite said. ""If there's a borrower in Shanghai, we can connect them to a lender in Cincinnati. We expect to be able to do that within a year or two.""";social economy;
457;Gurgaon-based peer-to-peer lending website Faircent recently raised venture capital at an enterprise valuation of US$4 million. The undisclosed funding round was led by Devesh Sachdev and Ashish Tiwari, promoters of Fusion Microfinance.The beauty of the P2P lending model is twofold: anyone can earn interest on their savings as a lender, and borrowers get much better terms than they would at banks. Faircent caters to those in need of retail and business loans using a format that allows it to keep institutional charges to a minimum to the benefit of users. Borrowers can directly interact with lenders, negotiate the terms and conditions of the interest rates, tenure of loans, and strike a deal. Both borrowers and lenders have to pay a listing fee.Faircent, which started operations in July 2014, spent nearly 12 months developing the platformís proprietary technology, which enables its underwriting and borrower rating system.Faircentís features include a bidding engine that helps users in interest rate discovery, a matchmaking technology to connect prospective borrowers and lenders as per their respective requirements, and an index of borrowers based on the purpose of the loan, amount, and tenure.Apart from bringing interested users together, the platform also uses an algorithm to figure out the creditworthiness of prospective borrowers and lenders by leveraging big data-based models that factor in personal, demographic, financial, national credit bureau, and social networking data to determine the rating of borrowers.This is a shift from the lender-borrower dynamic, as the borrower has the upper hand with an option to accept or reject the offers from the lenders.In an event where a borrower defaults, the lender will have the right to initiate proceedings against the borrower. Faircent states that it does not identify itself as a financial institution, but acts as a platform to facilitate a transaction of borrowing and lending between two users. However, the firm can blacklist the name and details of defaulters.The startup, which was self-funded by the founders Rajat Gandhi, Vinay Mathews, and Nitin Gupta will use the new influx of cash to strengthen their technology, talent, and brand focus.Faircent will be share the P2P lending space with the likes of Angaros Group-backed I-Lend and a host of social fund-raising platforms including MicroGraam, Rang De, and Milaap.;social economy;https://www.techinasia.com/faircent-receives-angel-funding/
458;In a move that expands its SME financing, Lending Club announced it will extend multi-draw lines of credit to small business borrowers.The new multi-draw option enables borrowers to withdraw only the funds they need, as they need them ñ instead of extending all funds up front and charging interest on the full sum from the start of the term. Lending Club charges a 1% to 2% fee each time borrowers draw down on the line of credit.It is free to apply for and open a line of credit, which ranges from $5,000 to $300,000 and charges interest rates starting at 6%, and there is no hard credit inquiry.Lending Club CEO, Renaud Laplanche states:ìOur platformís new multi-draw line of credit product gives them a predictable, flexible, low cost way to access credit ëon demandí if and when they need it,îTo qualify for the new offering, which has been in beta for the past few months with Alibaba.com and Ingram Micro customers, the borrowing company needs to have been operating for at least two years and have $75,000/ year in revenue.;social economy;http://finovate.com/lending-club-launches-sme-multi-draw-line-of-credit/

460;"A pair of former miners are hoping to launch a crowdfunding website in Australia for small mining companies struggling to raise capital via traditional outlets as lenders turn their back on the sector. Crowdfunding in Australia to raise equity is prohibited under the nation's Corporations Act. The founders of Mineral Intelligence Pty, however, are counting on this to change by the end of the year under pro-business initiatives being considered by lawmakers.U.S. securities regulators approved new crowdfunding rules on Friday, allowing start-up companies to raise money for the first time from mom-and-pop investors over the internet.Over the past three years, tens of thousands of jobs have gone in Australian mining, once the nation's economic engine, while some executives have taken pay cuts or forsaken bonuses to support the bottom line in the absence of fresh capital.Shared office space among companies has become commonplace to cut down on rents and perks such as gourmet foods and language lessons at mining camps have been eliminated.  ""The lack of equity finance continues to be the most significant business constraint for mineral exploration and mining companies,"" said Simon Bennison, chief executive of the Association of Mining and Exploration companies, representing many of Australia's smaller miners.Crowdfunding could pave the way for prospectors to raise cash to pay for exploration work at the earliest and riskiest stages of development and provide investors with early opportunities.""Traditionally, this has been the domain of a select few industry insiders, geologists, mining entrepreneurs and prospectors with the knowledge and industry connections required to get in the ground floor of new mining ventures,"" Market Intelligence's Managing Director Cameron McLean said. McLean and the company's co-founder, Joe Treacy, are both former executives of the now-defunct zinc miner Kagara Ltd.The key issue facing Australia's small-capped mining firms is the difficulty in raising capital, according to a survey of 108 firms by Grant Thornton Australia.The number of companies surviving on very low cash balances is increasing, with 29 percent of having less than A$500,000 ($357,000) in cash, the survey showed.  McLean said the company had already complied a list of 60 mining projects worldwide that could benefit from crowdfunding and was building a database of senior executives and others in the sector available to the site's subscribers, who will each pay A$5,000 a year. In August, Australia's then-communications minister and now prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, blamed government bureaucracy for a lack of legislation to allow crowd-sourced equity funding for start-up businesses, and said new rules would be introduced by January";social economy;http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/11/02/us-mining-australia-crowdfunding-idUKKCN0SR0LT20151102
461;"On Friday, the Securities and Exchange Commission voted 3-1 to allow small investors to buy stock in startup companies via online crowdfunding, reports Reuters and the Associated Press.Before the new rules, private companies could seek money only from ""accredited investors."" That's defined as individuals who own more than $1 million in assets, excluding their primary residence, or have maintained an income of more than $200,000 for at least two years.Under the new rules, those with more modest wealth will be able to invest in startups, with limits.People with annual income or net worth less than $100,000 will be allowed to invest a maximum of 5 percent of their yearly income or net worth, or $2,000 if that is greater. Those with higher incomes can invest up to 10 percent. An individual can't invest a total of more than $100,000 in all crowdfunding offerings during a 12-month period. Investors generally couldn't resell their crowdfunding securities for one year.Companies will be able to gather up to $1 million in crowdfunding cash per year without registering with the SEC. They'll have to provide investors details about their business, how they'll use the money, a list of officers and directors, and disclose anyone who owns at least 20 percent of the company.The new rules were called for in the 2012 JOBS Act, which relaxed various federal regulations in order to spur job growth. The SEC was left with latitude about how exactly the rules should look.Commissioner Michael Piwowar, currently the sole Republican commissioner, voted against the crowdfunding rules, arguing they were too strict.While individual investors may dream of getting in on the ground floor of the next Uber or Twitter, it's a high-risk activity. Most small businesses ultimately fail. The rule of thumb for tech startups is that out of 10 startups, only one or two will produce significant returns.Some experts have warned that crowd-funded investments could be ripe for scams, as well.

462;British crowdfunding platform Seedrs is planning to open up in the US within weeks, following a rule change that makes it easier for American savers to buy small amounts of company stocks.Seedrs beta test will offer US-accredited investors the opportunity to invest in selected campaigns listed on Seedrs, with an official launch expected in early 2016. The full launch is expected to allow non-accredited investors to take part too.Seedrs, launched in the UK in 2009, is an online crowdfunding platform that lets people buy stock in fast-growing startups from as little as £10. Startups looking for cash will sell a certain amount of shares on the platform for a set funding goal.Backers of Seedrs include star fund manager Neil Woodford, a venture capital fund backed by Lord Rothschild, and Andy Murray, who sits on the company's advisory board.The expansion comes after the US Securities and Exchange Committee (SEC) on Friday approved Title III of the JOBS Act, allowing non-accredited investors to buy stock in companies alongside accredited investors.To be an accredited investor in the US you must have a net worth of at least $1 million or have had an income of $200,000 for the past 2 years. That's a high bar and means there is a much smaller pool of people available to invest on equity crowdfunding platforms in the US.But the ruling allows ordinary people to put money into these companies over platforms like Seedrs.Seedrs bought California-based crowdfunding platform Junction Investments in late 2014 but has been lobbying for rule changes in the US to allow its business model to work.Seedrs' founder and CEO Jeff Lynn said in an emailed statement:I have had the privilege of being involved in the lawmaking process for U.S. crowdfunding ever since the JOBS Act was introduced in 2011, and I am very pleased to see that the SEC has finally adopted rules implementing Title III.We believe this heralds the emergence of equity crowdfunding as a vibrant form of finance in the United States ó just as it has become in the UK and Europe ó and Seedrs is perfectly positioned to take advantage of the sectorís growth.

467;European peer-to-peer lender Bondora has entered the Canadian marketplace offering investors an opportunity for higher-yield returns on the European loan market.Bondora, an Estonia-based online lender, entered the Canadian market at the end of September and allows accredited investors the opportunity to invest directly in personal unsecured loans across three European markets: Finland, Estonia and Spain. (An accredited investor has to have a minimum individual income of $250,000.) ìWe are able to provide investors with a diversified spread of different loan exposures in different jurisdictions, multiple geographies and various risk classes of loans,î said Partel Tomberg, chief executive officer and co-founder of Bondora. ìThe borrowing markets we operate in have highly inefficient banking systems and limited alternative financing options for borrowers ñ thus ensuring premium returns to investors.îSince the companyís launch in 2009, Bondora has processed over Ä400-million ($587.1-million) of loan applications and consistently delivered double-digit returns to investors ñ averaging 18 per cent, says Mr. Tomberg.ìOver time, we anticipate investment returns to somewhat decrease as we expand the platform to include new markets where the banking consumer-loan rates might be lower than in the current countries we presently working in,î he said. ìBut it will also further reduce the volatility and risk for investors.îCurrently, Mr. Tomberg is preparing to expand the lending platform to eight more euro zone countries ñ with plans to be present in all that regionís countries by 2017.Peer-to-peer lending is still in its infancy in Canada compared with the U.S. and European markets. Last June, one of the provincial regulators, the Ontario Securities Commission, stated that newly emerging companies in the industry appear to have different structures from one another and some may be subject to regulation, depending on how loans are provided and whether the loan products constitute a ìsecurityî under Ontario legislation.As well, the OSC suggested some providers may be subject to regulation and could even be required to register as investment dealers.Bondora has yet to meet with Canadian regulators but plans to discuss options before expanding to the whole Canadian retail market.ìIf we arenít able to work directly with retail investors, we will look to see if we can work together with a securities provider ñ or a fund manager ñ who can help incorporate these loans into a more traditional portfolio that is sold to the retail investors,î Mr. Tomberg said. ìWe believe that this type of investment is superior to many other fixed income investments ñ of course, it can carry higher risks because it is unsecured personal loans but on a diversified portfolio basis it will provide an overall solid return to investors.îIn early 2015, Bondora received $5-million (U.S.) in financing from Valinor Management, a U.S.-based private investment firm. Valinor is one of the early backers ñ and largest shareholders ñ in Lending Club, the largest peer lender in the United States.On a global scale, Bondora has more than 9,000 investors ñ mainly from the European market ñ and is now adding Canada, the United States, Mexico, Brazil, India, Hong Kong, Switzerland, India, Singapore, South Korea, Japan, India and Australia.Individual loans range from Ä500 to Ä10,000, with the average loan request being approximately Ä3,000. Borrowers pay a fixed monthly fee of 2.6 per cent per annum, which is added on top of the interest paid to investors.On the online platform, there is no maximum amount that investors can contribute and Mr. Tomberg says that in the European market, they are allocating an average of 5 per cent to 8 per cent of their portfolio to the offering.But clients should be cautious of the amount they allocate for this type of investment in their portfolio, says Gregor McDonald, a financial planner with Vision Financial Planning in St. Catharines, Ont.ìIf a client came forward with this opportunity, I would definitely accentuate the risk of losing all their money and invest only what they can realistically afford to lose,î Mr. McDonald said. ìThe clientís financial plan should be revisited to see what impact a 100-per-cent loss would have and keep the investment amount to a reasonable measure ñ which would be a minimal amount of the portfolio.îThe global player will be entering a market that already has a handful of competitors operating including Grouplend, Borrowell and Lending Loop.Grouplend CEO Kevin Sandhu launched his platform in 2014 and says while it is exciting to see more options for Canadian investors to participate in online credit as an attractive asset class, investors may be more inclined to invest funds to directly help Canadian borrowers before crossing international borders.ìInvesting outside of Canada not only presents unique risks, but also takes away some of the social impact of investing,î Mr. Sandhu said. ìInvesting abroad, particularly in emerging markets, can be a great way to diversify an investorís portfolio and gain more exposure to this exciting asset class, but we find many of our investors are as excited by the opportunity to help their fellow Canadians save money as they are in the prospect of compelling investment returns.î;social economy;http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/investment-ideas/european-peer-to-peer-lender-bondora-enters-canadian-market/article26709682/

469;A gaggle of business school graduates is among the growing number of start-up entrepreneurs hoping to electrify the fast-growing peer-to-peer lending market. The P2P industry has risen prominence over the past two years, with more than £500 million being lent to individuals and businesses in the second quarter of this year alone. Market leaders such as Zopa, which pioneered online direct lending, and which was founded by INSEAD business school graduate Giles Andrews, are jostling with niche platforms focusing on areas such as real estate and invoice financing. Nearly 300 P2P businesses have sought full or partial permission to operate from the Financial Conduct Authority since the UK regulator began overseeing the sector last year, according to new figures from Bovill, the regulatory consultancy. Amid the financial technology, or fintech, frenzy MBA graduates are leading innovation in P2P. Business school start-ups in the industry include US based crowdfunding site Indiegogo, founded by Haas School MBA Danae Ringelmann, and cash transfer platform WorldRemit, founded by London Business School graduate Ismail Ahmed. The P2P industry is coming of age, confirmed by the floatation last year of Lending Club, the Silicon Valley based platform founded by Renaud Laplanche, who studied at HEC Paris, a leading French business school. The Peer-to-Peer Finance Association, a trade body, forecasts that lending will exceed £2.5 billion in the UK in 2015. The US is by far the biggest market, with P2P lenders there having already raised more than $8 billion for their users. The largest P2P lenders focus on matching borrowers with investors, such SoFi, a student loan specialist which was set-up by Stanford GSB MBA Michael Cagney. Since its foundation in 2011, the company has raised more than $750 million in venture capital. In June SoFi said it had hit the $3 billion mark in loans funded through its platform. Chief executive Michael, said the milestone is a testament to the companyís ability to cater to professionals who have been ìrepeatedly overlooked by traditional financial institutionsî. Other P2P platforms have focused on equity funding, targeting start-up businesses that need seed and growth capital. Goncalo de Vasconcelos founded SyndicateRoom, an investor-led equity platform, the same year he graduated from the MBA at Cambridge Judge Business School in the UK. The platform has helped raise more than £31 million since its launch in 2012. Goncalo said SyndicateRoomís vision is that for every pound invested, everybody makes or loses the same amount of money. ìEquity crowdfunding is a beautiful thing ó it helps entrepreneurs raise finance in a more efficient way, but it has to work for investors for it to be sustainable,î he said. Goncalo believes that his MBA has been of benefit to SyndicateRoom, which was named after a study area at Cambridge Judge. ìIt gives you that credibility. It opens doors,î he said, while also providing a boost to confidence. Goncalo also values his MBA network. ìEveryone wants to chip in with ideas. We had really valuable feedback,î he added. Ayan Mitra, the founder and chief executive of CrowdBnk, an equity and structured debt crowdfunding platform, said that his MBA network has come in handy. ìPeople back each other,î he said. An MBA also spurred him to begin his entrepreneurial journey. ìIt changes your outlook towards life,î he said of the degree he earned at London Business School. Since its launch in 2013, CrowdBnk has helped users raise £17 million in funding. P2P lenders emerged as challengers to traditional lenders, which are seen as slow moving and lacking in innovation, although many P2P platforms have since partnered with banks. Ayan said that the P2P market will ìdisruptî traditional lenders: ìAlternative finance platforms are here to stay.î Increasingly, industry leaders such as Transferwise, also founded by an INSEAD alumnus, are being joined by specialist online marketplaces. One such venture is We Are Pop Up, a digital marketplace for short-term retail property, founded in 2012 by Nicholas Russell, a graduate of Oxford Universityís SaÔd Business School. Styled as an alternative to commercial property agents, the company has signed up ìhundredsî of landlords, and has raised $2.7 million in venture capital. Nicholas, CEO, is riding a ìpower shiftî away from commercial landlords to consumers. ìWhen we went through our accelerator program two years ago people didnít even know what proptech was,î he said in reference to the nascent property-tech market. ìWhere we are [now] is really exciting,î he said.;social economy;http://www.businessbecause.com/news/mba-entrepreneurs/3414/fintech-mba-entrepreneurs-electrify-p2p-lending
470;So this is awkward. Peer-to-peer lending websites are having trouble finding people who want to borrow money.Companies like Lending Club, Prosper, and Social Finance, which use technology to link borrowers with other individuals who want to lend to them, have been wildly successful. Since Lending Club went public last December, speculation has swirled about IPOs by Prosper and Sofi.Wall Street bankers and money managers are paying attention. Earlier this year, the worldís largest asset manager Black Rock bought $330 million of consumer debt through Prosper. And firms have flooded the peer-to-peer platforms with billions of dollars. The influx of Wall Street money comes as record low interest rates make it increasingly difficult to find higher-yielding investments. The interest rate on a Lending Club loan can range from 7.5% to 25%, much higher than many other investments. (For example, the Barclays US aggregate bond index, a broad gauge of the US bond market, currently yields a bit more than 2%.)Thereís only one problem. Many peer-to-peer lending companies are seeing more demand from investors who want to lend money than there are borrowers who want to take out loans. Nearly 50% of whole loans on Prosper are now being snapped up by investors in less than 10 seconds, according to Orchard Platform, which links institutions to marketplace lending.ìThereís no doubt thereís an imbalance,î Prosper President Ron Suber tells Quartz. ìProsper needs borrowers.îTo attract credit-worthy borrowers, Prosper is partnering with companies like Spirit Airlines, which now offers mileage rewards for borrowers who sign up for loans;social economy;http://qz.com/367535/peer-to-peer-lenders-cant-find-enough-borrowers/
471;To gain access to new types of borrowers, Prosper also spent $21 million in January to buy American Healthcare Lending, which helps doctors make loans to patients wanting elective medical procedures like liposuction and fertility treatments. Lending Club bought a similar financing company for $140 million last year.And Prosper and Lending Club have both been striking partnerships with community banks in the US, which can refer loans they donít want to the online lenders. Itís a practice already underway in Britain, where the government is trying to make referrals compulsory to boost lending and jumpstart the economy.For its part, Lending Club says itís ìneither supply or demand constrained,î CEO Renaud Laplanche told Quartz, pointing out the amount the company spends on sales and marketing actually dropped to 37% of revenue in 2014 from 53% in 2012.The industry will also likely get a borrower boost once interest rates rise and if the Securities and Exchange Commission follows through on plans to lower the bar for qualified investors.Sure, marketplace lending makes up less than 1% of the worldís loans and companies like Prosper and Lending Club say they have no plans to change their stringent underwriting standards, but the marketing overdrive is certainly worth keeping an eye on.If the subprime mortgage collapse during the last decade taught us anything, intense competition for borrowers can lead to looser underwriting standards. And offering unsecured loans to borrowers who canít pay them offóespecially through less-regulated online lending platformsócan only end badly.;social economy;http://qz.com/367535/peer-to-peer-lenders-cant-find-enough-borrowers/
472;"Lending Club, the worldís biggest peer-to-peer lender, has launched a landmark tie-up with Google to provide small business loans to the technology groupís partners.The deal with Google, one of Lending Clubís largest investors, comes a month after the ìP2Pî lender debuted on the New York Stock Exchange in a move aimed at raising new funds and increasing awareness of the fast-growing peer-to-peer sector.FirstFT is our new essential daily email briefing of the best stories from across the webPeer-to-peer lenders, also known as marketplace lenders, seek to use online platforms and new technology to connect borrowers with lenders directly, in an easier and more efficient way than traditional banking.While Lending Clubís business was once focused purely on consumer loan deals struck between individuals, more than half of its loans are now said to be funded by large professional investors such as hedge funds and wealth managers.It has expanded into new types of lending and struck partnerships with different companies, including banks, as it seeks to maintain its growth; since being founded in 2006, the San Francisco-based group has extended $6.2bn worth of credit. Through the pilot programme announced on Thursday with Google, Lending Club will facilitate loans to Google partners including resellers, consultants and system integrators which help the tech group distribute its applications and services.Renaud Laplanche, Lending Clubís founder and chief executive, said he expects to develop further partnerships with Google and other companies.ìThe opportunity here is really to do something with large corporations that always wanted to provide credit to their partners but didnít have the compliance, the origination capabilities and the servicing capacity,î he said.Analysts said the deal marked an evolution for Lending Club, where small business loans represent only 2 per cent of its lending. At up to $600,000 for two years, the Google partner loans will be larger than the maximum $300,000 that Lending Club has so far been offering to small business borrowers.ìWhat I think is most important here is it underlines the fact that Lending Club is not resting on its laurels with its existing business plan,î said Mark Palmer, analyst at BTIG. ìItís going to be adding new distribution channels and new verticals.îPeer-to-peer lenders are striving to balance supply of new loans on their platforms with demand from big investors who are keen to buy the higher-yielding securities. Mr Palmer said partnerships with companies and retail stores were a promising way of sourcing fresh loans for the platforms.Mr Laplanche has also expressed interest in experimenting with new financial offerings including insurance.ìWeíve only scratched the surface of the number of applications for this approach,î said Mr Palmer.Google bought an 8 per cent stake in Lending Club in 2013 for $125m. Back then, the purchase valued the company at an estimated $1.55bn. Lending Clubís shares rose about 4.7 per cent to $22.02 by midday on Thursday in New York, giving the company a market value of $7.6bn.

473;Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending is a fast developing market for individuals and small businesses looking to lend or borrow money. It has the potential to challenge the dominance of traditional financial institutions like banks, but involves new risks for both lenders and borrowers.In its simplest form, P2P uses a web platform to connect savers and borrowers directly. In this form, the saver lends funds directly to the borrower. Few providers offer such a ìplain vanillaî product. A P2P platform matches individuals using proprietary algorithms. It works like a dating website to assess the credit risk of potential borrowers and determine what interest rate should be charged. It also provides the mechanics to transfer the funds from the saver to the borrower. The same mechanics allow the borrower to repay the money with interest according to the agreed contract.Local players in the P2P market (not all yet operational) include Society One, RateSetter, Direct-Money, ThinCats and MoneyPlace.There are many ways that the basic framework can differ. This affects the types of risk faced by both lenders and borrowers. Protecting the borrowerís identity from the lender is important. What if the lender is a violent thug who takes umbrage if payments arenít met? Protecting the borrower brings another risk. The lender must rely on the operator to select suitable borrowers and take appropriate action to maximise recoveries.The operator can provide a wide range of services. For example, lenders might have a shorter time frame than borrowers, or discover that they need their funds back earlier than they thought. The operator may provide facilities to accommodate that. Or, rather than lenders being exposed to the default risk of a particular borrower, the operator may provide a risk-pooling service, whereby exposure is to the average of all (or some group of) loans outstanding.The further these services extend, the more the P2P operator starts to look like a traditional bank ñ but not one reliant on bricks and mortar, nor on the traditional mechanisms of credit analysis relying on customer banking data. The explosion of alternative sources of information (including social media) about an individualís behaviour, characteristics, and contacts for instance, provide new opportunities for credit assessment analysis based on applying computer algorithms to such sources of data.While the traditional three Cís of loan assessment (character, collateral, cash flow) remain important, new data and ways of making such assessments are particularly relevant to P2P operators. Indeed P2P operators go beyond the credit scoring models found in banks in their use of technology and data, unencumbered by the legacy of existing bank technology and processes. It is partly this flexibility which explains their growth overseas and forecasts of substantial market penetration in Australia. Much of that growth can be expected to come from acceptance by younger customers of the technology involved ñ and about whom there is more information available from social media to inform credit assessments.But also relevant is, of course, the wide margins between bank deposit interest rates and personal loan rates. With - arguably - lower operating costs and ability to match or better bank credit assessment ability, P2P operators are able to offer higher interest rates to lenders and lower rates to borrowers than available from banks.For lenders, higher interest rates are offset to some degree by the higher risk to their funds. Unlike bank deposits, P2P lenders bear the credit risk of loan defaults ñ although P2P operators would argue the risk can be relatively low due to good selection of borrowers and mechanisms for enabling lenders to diversify their funds across a range of borrowers.For borrowers, the main risks arise from the consequences of being unable to meet loan repayments. There is little experience available in the Australian context to understand whether P2P operators will respond to delinquencies by borrowers in a different manner to banks.Itís important that P2P isnít confused with payday lending where low income, high credit risk, borrowers unable to meet repayments can quickly find themselves in dire straits by rolling over very short term loans at high interest rates.The two business models can overlap ñ with payday lenders offering loan facilities via web based platforms. One challenge for P2P operators is to ensure the community and regulators accept their model as one of being responsible lenders to credit worthy clients. They also need to convince regulators that these unfamiliar business models do not pose unacceptable risks to potential customers.P2P lending could have major benefits to individuals who want to invest, lend or borrow money. Hopefully regulators will be able to distinguish between good and bad business models. If they canít, they could prevent a profound challenge to traditional banking.;social economy;http://theconversation.com/what-you-need-to-know-about-peer-to-peer-lending-38836
474;Legend Holdings, the holding company of Lenovo computer, is expanding into peer to peer lending and other forms of finance.  The investments are part of an overriding strategy to both acquire and grow core assets while simultaneously boosting growth with non organic expansion.  Legend hopes to become a publicly traded holding company within the next two years.  Legend is controlled by Liu Chuanzhi who founded the company in 1984 with ten engineers and only 200,000 yuan.Liu ChuanzhiLegend has been investing in several online financial services since September an approach replicated by several other large China based internet companies as the intrinsic synergies and compelling opportunities have become more significant.  Peer to peer lending was estimated to top 300 billion yuan in 2014 (over $48 billion).Legendís incubator unit invested in Yindou back in September of 2104.  In November, Legend announced an investment in ELoancn ñ the earliest peer to peer lending platform in China.  The investments are considered an ìimportant signalî by legend of its future intent and strategy.  Eloancn has established more than 1,000 operation centers in over 100 domestic cities. Meanwhile, Eloancn has conducted standard operations persistently, allocated customersí funds via third-party payment platforms, and established a multi-level and all-round risk control process involving local operators, finance, legal service and overall risk control to ensure investorsí fund security. Data show Eloancnís total transaction volume reached tens of millions of yuan in 2012, increased to 300 million yuan in 2013 under the drive of the concept of P2P lending, soared to 1.723 billion yuan on October 31, 2014 and topped 200 million yuan every month after August 2014.Legend is of the firm belief that ìthe prosperity of Internet technologies has created a lot of opportunities for Chinaís economic restructuring, the upgrading of Chinaís traditional industries and the development of Chinaís emerging industries, so as to become the immense impetus for business and social innovation. Internet finance has risen to generate a series of new modes such as P2P lending and investment & financing in recent years, which have not only created great convenience for the peopleís life, but also made inclusive finance possible.îEloanCNAccording to a report in WantChinaTimes, the P2P lending portal Wangdaizhijia, the total value of loans brokered by the P2P platforms in China grew from 105.8 billion yuan (US$17 billion) in 2013 to 252.8 billion yuan (US$40.7 billion) in 2014, despite the collapse of several operators. Deals processed by ELoancn jumped from 300 million yuan (US$48 million) in 2013 to 2.4 billion yuan (US$387 million) in 2014, making the company one of the front runners in the emerging sector, the newspaper said.ELoancn founder Wang Sicong was reported clarifying during an event in December that the investments made by large companies in the P2P sector will generate more business opportunities.According to ELoancn, ìAs a strategic investor, Legend Holdings does not pursue short-term gains or withdraw for gains, shares the common goal of ëgrowing strongí with invested enterprises, its tremendous strength, rich experience and corporate culture of integrity and truth are bound to cause Eloancnís qualitative leaps in such aspects as enterprise management, brand building, talent development and training, IT technology upgrading and user experience.î;social economy;http://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2015/01/60916-lenovo-expanding-peer-peer-lending/
475;Peer-to-peer lending ñ where savers lend money to individuals or small businesses ñ is 10 years old this weekend. P2P websites cut out the banks by putting people with money to lend in touch with those wanting to borrow, and offers them the chance to secure a better return on their money than they would get by putting it into a traditional savings account.At the end of its first decade in operation, Zopa, the pioneer in this sector, has just passed £750m in lending, and expects to hit £1bn this summer. It has been joined by dozens more operators. It is expected that P2P loans may soon be permitted in tax-free Isas, but beware ñ none of these schemes qualify for the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) scheme if things go wrong.ï How do rates stack up?P2P providers offer average returns of 4.4% on three-year fixed-rate accounts, almost double the average ìbest-buyî three-year fixed-rate savings account paying just 2.5%. The key is to do your homework and research the various firms, while also thinking about your own investment strategy When P2P started, Zopa was offering rates to lenders of between 5% and 6% (after fees and losses from bad debts), but this is now down to 4% for up to three years and 5.1% for five years. The second biggest player, RateSetter, has slightly higher rates: it is offering 2.6% for a month, 3.5% for a year, 5.5% for three years and 6.1% for five.Funding Circle, which lends to businesses rather than individuals, had a headline rate this week of 6.8% ñ a figure which is updated daily. Rival ThinCats boasts a bigger average return of 9%, while MarketInvoice says investors can earn gross annual returns of ìover 10%î. Note, however, that rates do fluctuate.ï Is my money safe?In a positive move for investors, P2P lending is now regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, a protection introduced in April 2014. Despite this, P2P is still not covered by the FSCS.That said, some firms have their own systems in place to try to limit the risk. ìRateSetter, for example, operates a ëprovision fundí to help protect savers against defaults,î says Andrew Hagger of Moneycomms. ìZopa has always spread investorsí money among many customers to minimise risk, and has also introduced its own ësafeguard fundí.îWith Funding Circle, money is spread between at least 100 borrowers, so if one or two fail to repay, the impact on your return is arguably negligible.Hagger adds: ìWhile even the established sites are not risk-free, the default rate has, so far, been low.îï Which firm should I choose?  You may want to go for one that belongs to the P2P Finance Association, members of which are required to operate by a strict set of rules in order to promote high standards of conduct and consumer protection.Membership currently comprises Zopa, RateSetter, Funding Circle, ThinCats, MarketInvoice, Madiston LendLoanInvest, LendInvest, Lending Works and Landbay. That said, Richard Watts from crowdfunding and P2P comparison website Nurture Money argues that while only a handful of platforms belong to the P2PFA, this doesnít mean these are the only options. ìThere are other platforms which are not part of the association which are still acting in the right way,î he says. ìThe key is to do your homework and research the various firms, while also thinking about your own investment strategy.îï Can I put it in an Isa?There have long been calls to allow P2P investments to be included within Isas, and the industry hopes for an announcement in this monthís budget. One major concern, however, is that P2P may get included as part of a stocks and shares Isa. The industry fears this could make things complicated for investors, and is pushing for a separate ìlending Isaî.Danny Cox at Hargeaves Lansdown says: ìThe most likely route is a ënewí type of Isa just for P2P and crowdfunding. That said, while many expect an announcement in the near future, I think weíre still some way off this.îï Can I loan out my pension money?There are only a few weeks to go until reforms letting older people cash in their pension pots take effect on 6 April. But while the idea of spreading your money around a host of P2P firms offering returns of 5% may sound more appealing than exchanging your life savings for an annuity, retirees are being urged to tread very carefully.ìP2P may be an attractive option to investors looking for higher yields from alternative finance, but it is still a relatively new investment and a small market,î Cox says. ìThere are still questions about liquidity, the way some platforms credit-score their borrowers, and the stability of yields and defaults in the event of an economic downturn. Overall, P2P should not in most cases form more than 10% of a pension portfolio.îTim Maher-De Troyer, from Oxted, Surrey, has been a Zopa lender from the start and still has money invested. The 61-year-old, who lives with his wife Lucie, 60, started out by lending £1,000 back in April 2005.ìI had been investing in the stock exchange since 1999, so was quite familiar with the financial markets,î says Maher-De Troyer, an independent IT specialist. ìWhen I heard about this new proposition, I did a bit of research and decided to give it a try. I liked the fact it had an air of social awareness about it.îJust weeks later he experienced some volatility in his working life, so decided to apply to borrow money through the website to help him manage his finances. His application for a £6,000 loan was quickly accepted.ìThis meant I got to try out both sides of the equation,î he says. ìZopa has worked well for me, both as an investor and a borrower, and Iíve been very impressed by the ethos of the firm.îOnce things got back on track, he started lending through Zopa again. ìIíve been a full-time lender now since 2008 and currently have £4,500 invested, although this can fluctuate, and Iíve had up to £20,000 loaned out at times. Over the years I have taken some losses ñ totalling a few hundred pounds ñ but this was well within my risk profile. And this has been far outweighed by the fact I have earned an average rate of 6.5% over the 10 years Iíve been a customer.î;social economy;http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/mar/06/peer-to-peer-lending-p2p-returns-investment
476;Founded by WeLab, a finance startup, WeLend is the first social lending platform based in Hong Kong. Since launching in early July, WeLab says it has received US$6 million in loan applications.The social, or peer-to-peer, lending industry in the U.S. has existed since 2006, when Prosper and Lending Club were both founded. In mainland China, prominent peer-to-peer lending platforms include Creditease, SinoLending and PPDai. Despite Hong Kongís status as an international financial center, however, there were no peer-to-peer lending platforms before WeLab launched. Simon Loong, founder and CEO, says the startup is currently focused on educating potential borrowers about WeLabís services. Loong hopes his fifteen years in the banking industry, including a position as North East Asia Regional Head of Unsecured Lending at Standard Chartered Bank, will help WeLab gain credibility and grow.Though informal lending clubs are common in Hong Kong, barriers to entry for peer-to-peer platforms include stringent financial regulations and competition from dominant players in the banking industry such as HSBC, Standard Chartered and Citicorp.ìIn the past when you resided in the same village, youíd lend money to one another. Thatís the essential concept behind the peer-to-peer model,î says Loong. ìItís an interesting fact that we hear often when we do user education. People say that their grandfatherís generation did this in their village. Now we are looking at how we can scale that model by using our banking experience.î;social economy;http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/04/welend-welab/
477;"In the last decade, peer-to-peer lendersóonline platforms that connect credit-seeking consumers directly to potential lendersóhave helped customers borrow to refinance student loans, pay off credit card debt and build their small businesses.Now, one lender wants to disrupt the market for mortgage originations, long dominated by big banks.San Francisco-based lender SoFi (short for ""Social Finance"") has been quietly testing the waters to underwrite new mortgages for existing customers living in states like California, New Jersey, North Carolina and Texas. After beta testing more than 100 mortgages, SoFi is opening the platform more broadly.It's a multibillion-dollar opportunity,"" SoFi CEO Mike Cagney told CNBC.The program boasts loans up to $3 million, with as little as 10 percent down, and a 21-day application turnaroundóbut is limited to six states.When SoFi launched in 2011, it focused squarely on the burgeoning student loan marketóa market that, unlike housing, had no viable option to refinance both federal and private student loans from higher interest-rate eras. Since then, SoFi has provided more than $1 billion in funding for students from select universities (read: schools with promising income capacity) to consolidate or refi college or grad school debt.That high-income market (""doctors, lawyers, finance folks, technology folks"") is, according to Cagney, a ""beachhead"" into housing: ""The next life cycle for someone after you've paid off a student loan or paying down a student loan is home acquisition.""Cagney experienced the difficulty of getting a mortgage firsthand when he made the leap from Wells Fargo's proprietary trading desk to SoFi, then a fledgling start-up that came with a large pay cut. Mortgage bankers ""were modeling that my income would be negative in a few years,"" Cagney said. ""I feel for Ben Bernanke.""Carving a nicheSoFi is clearly trying to benefit from the fact that the burden of student debt has made home ownership a distant reality for many millennials. The company, more important, is also trying to carve out a niche in an increasingly crowded landscape of companies seeking to disintermediate Wall Street banks from consumer finance.";social economy;http://www.cnbc.com/2014/10/07/would-you-bypass-a-bank-for-your-next-mortgage.html
478;"Lending Club, the industry's largest, targets a range of credit profiles for smaller loans (on average, about $14,000 per borrower) that are used to refinance credit card debt and will be a test for the market when it goes public later this year.Prosper, the oldest and second-largest peer-to-peer lender, does much the same, but has tended to target even riskier borrowers, says industry investor and blogger Peter Renton of Lend Academy.Renton said SoFi's venture into mortgages shouldn't cause alarm, because the company is targeting borrowers with little credit history that would otherwise be considered ""super-prime.""""We're talking, 780 FICO scores, $180,000 in income,"" Renton said of SoFi's customer base. ""You couldn't find a better group of borrowers on the planet.""Peer-to-peer lenders originally sought to attract retail investors to its loan marketplace, but the lack of high-returning assets elsewhere in the market has made these platforms increasingly attractive to major asset managers and hedge funds.So attractive that the company has completed two rounds of securitizing its student loans into bundles that investment banks can sell to institutional investors. A $251 million round was completed in July and earned an ""A"" rating from Standard & Poor's.""The last securitization that we did it was 15 times oversubscribed on the institutional side,"" Cagney told CNBC. ""I anticipate that we can generate strong demand as we bring mortgage to market.""While securitizing loans helps SoFi find other parties to shoulder some of the loan risk and share the cost of interest, it does call to mind the role that such bundlesóalbeit less creditworthy, and on a much larger scaleówere one of the biggest culprits of the financial crisis.SoFi executives are quick to point out that in its eight years, with nearly 14,000 borrowers, not a single loan that has been underwritten has gone into default.";social economy;http://www.cnbc.com/2014/10/07/would-you-bypass-a-bank-for-your-next-mortgage.html
479;Peer-to-peer lending, or P2P lending, took off in the mid-2000s at a time when many borrowers were growing frustrated with mainstream financial institutionsí dominance of the loan process. Unlike more traditional lending practices, P2P lending provides the potential for greater returns for investors and lower interest rates for borrowers, both of which have helped make this alternate way of lending increasingly popular.The success of Lending Club and Prosper, P2P lending platforms that pair up borrowers with investors, has also bolstered the growth of P2P lending. Lending Club started in 2007 and made loans worth $3.5 million in its first year. That figure has since grown to $3.4 billion. While this explosive growth suggests that many investors think P2P lending is a perfectly safe alternative to more traditional forms of investing, there are undeniable risks.Unlike government-backed loans, for example, P2P loans are not insured. Moreover, Prosper faced serious legal issues in 2008, when the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a cease and desist order against the company, claiming it was selling unregistered securities. Just one year later, Prosper rebooted its business after securing SEC registration for its loans, something all P2P lending platforms are now required to do. Apart from a now-settled lawsuit stemming from a group of disgruntled investors, Prosper has since steered clear of any legal issues, and recently received an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau.While these new regulations have gone a long way towards addressing consumer concern about P2P lending, itís still important to minimize the risks associated with this type of investing. Prudent steps include diversifying your investment mix.How does it work?Lending platforms like Lending Club and Prosper have quickly become popular and reliable ways of doing P2P lending. These websites simplify the process and do a lot of the work for you, like bookkeeping and transferring the funds in question, without charging as much as banks. After signing up with the website, borrowers essentially just select a loan amount (up to $35,000 if youíre using Lending Club) and describe where this money is going before posting a listing to the website.Investors, meanwhile, sort through these listings and invest in whatever they think will fetch the biggest returns. Borrowers make monthly payments, which investors receive a portion of.Because loans are uninsured, default can be especially painful for investors. For some, this risk is worth it, as returns can be substantial. Conservative, five-year U.S. Treasury notes usually yield 0.9%, while four-year corporate bonds can yield up to 7.33%. In comparison, a three-year loan rated B1 by Lending Club (on an A through G scale), can yield 10%.Minimizing risk P2P lending can be as safe as you make it. For those new to P2P lending, experts suggest starting conservatively and also diversifying your investments. In other words, donít lend all your money to one borrower. Instead, hedge your bets by lending just a bit of money to many borrowers. This is the best way to protect yourself against one devastating default, according to most experts. You can opt to invest in only a portion of a borrower's request on Lending Club or Prosper. The straightforward logic behind this is that itís unlikely that all of these borrowers would default on their loans.Prosper claims that, since 2009, investors with 100 or more loans in their portfolio have never lost money. Moreover, rather than having P2P investments serve as the main source of your income, experts recommend that they constitute just a fraction of your larger investment portfolio.Background checks serve as another security blanket: websites like Lending Club perform background checks on borrowers, which eliminate a lot of the mystery associated with lending money to someone youíve never met before. Youíll know the credit score of whomever you are lending money to, along with other pertinent facts about their financial background.Final thoughtsThanks to the success of lending platforms like Lending Club and Prosper, similar websites are proliferating quickly , and thus continue to give borrowers and investors plenty of ways to conduct loans and investments. Whatís more, several big players have given P2P lending a major endorsement. Just last year Goog invested $125 million in Lending Club. A few months after that announcement, Prosper received a $25 million investment from Sequoia Capital and BlackRock.A lot of money ñ and therefore trust ñ has been placed in the P2P lending model, which can be a great addition to your investment portfolio if you diversify your investments and practice the same good judgment you would when making any other important business decision.;social economy;http://www.nasdaq.com/article/is-peertopeer-lending-safe-cm358911
480;Whether we in the industry like it or not, peer-to-peer lending has for some time been lumped together with the likes of hedge funds, offbeat types of investment vehicles and even payday lenders in what is known as the ìshadow banking sectorî.This term was originally designed to cover those entities outside the regular banking system which were in the business of extending credit ñ and P2P certainly fits this definition. In the wake of the credit crunch and the global financial crisis, regulators were understandably worried about what other sources of systemic risk might have been overlooked. As a result, the Bank of England and its counterparts overseas have made it clear that shadow banking should and will come under greater scrutiny. One might see a certain irony in the fact that those institutions which were actually responsible for the meltdown in 2008 are by implication defined as ìnon-shadow banksî ñ particularly when it was the opacity and complexity of their disastrous multi-billion-dollar derivative trades and poor credit risk management that brought the financial system to its knees. But my aim here is not to go over old ground. Rather, I want to make the point that the activities of the P2P lender that I helped set up, Zopa, are as far from shadowy as the most diligent regulator could hope for. A founding principle of P2P lending is to ensure that platforms are open and transparent about lending.  When Zopa became the first P2P platform to launch in 2005, we knew that persuading consumers to trust us with their cash was crucial to our business. This meant being a transparent and responsible lender from the start, extending credit to ìsuper-primeî borrowers and building a risk function robust enough to withstand the seismic economic shocks that came along a few years later. More recently, Zopa has become one of a handful of platforms to open up their loan books and provide loan data ñ to the public and analyst AltFi Data. Anyone can now see exactly what returns we have been able to offer customers over the past decade, and at what level of risk. Furthermore, P2P lending is perhaps the only part of the banking industry that has actively lobbied for greater regulation ñ again, we see FCA oversight as vital in fostering consumer confidence in the sector. There is every indication now that P2P has emerged from the shadows: figures from the Peer-to-Peer Finance Association show that more than £459m was lent in the first quarter of 2015, an increase of almost a third on the final three months of 2014. Zopa itself should see its lifetime lending break through the £1bn barrier in the summer. Meanwhile, the Treasury has indicated that a new third type of Isa, devoted solely to P2P lending, is likely to be given the green light later this year, providing a mainstream platform for our industry. But whatever labels are attached to our sector, the fact is that the mainstream banks are nowhere near regaining the trust they lost in 2007-08, and consumers are increasingly of the view that P2P offers a much brighter and more transparent alternative. One where no shadows exist at all.;social economy;http://www.cityam.com/217115/peer-peer-lending-isn-t-shadow-banking-it-s-now-more-transparent-ever
481;"Sitting in an empty meeting room at his peer-to-peer mortgage business in west London, tech entrepreneur Christian Faes is not someone you would expect to be enthusiastically making the case for regulation or the importance of governments.But the Wollongong-born founder of LendInvest argues a little bit of intervention can be a good thing. Indeed, Faes says Australia could learn a lot from the UK experience in this fast-growing and much-hyped segment of the financial services industry. ìPeer-to-peer was arguably invented here [in 2005] with a company called Zopa,"" he says. ìAs a result there was an industry group formed called the Peer-to-Peer Finance Association which represents the main players in the UK.ìThey really effectively lobbied the government for the industry to be regulated, which people might think is an inhibitor to the market. But it was very clever in that it really brought a huge amount of credibility to the industry.""  At the same time Faes says the UK government was a ìhuge proponent"" of P2P lenders, crowdfunding and other technology platforms that provide individuals and small businesses wanting loans with an alternative to the high street banks. ìI just read the Murray report [prepared for the Abbott ≠governmentís financial system inquiry],"" he says. ìAnd if you look at it from a broader perspective it is really interesting that Australia seems to be a little bit late to the crowdfunding, peer-to-peer space.""Heating upIt would be wrong to say P2P lending has gone mainstream even though British P2P lenders such as Zopa, RateSetter and Funding Circle arranged more than £1.6 billion ($2.9 billion) worth of loans last year. While this number is forecast to almost double in the next six months, it remains a drop in the ocean compared with the countryís £1.2 trillion in retail deposits.Nevertheless, 2014 will be remembered as the year P2P made the financial markets sit up and take notice. In the United States there was the $US5.4 billion ($6.7 billion) float of Lending Club, a company formed just eight years earlier in California. Investors were so excited, the stock debuted at a 65 per cent premium to its issue price. The site has issued $US6 billion worth of loans over the past two years and last week announced a partnership with Google.     The start-up SocietyOne made headlines when it secured the backing of Crown Resorts chairman James Packer, Seven West Media director Ryan Stokes and News Corp co-chairman Lachlan Murdoch. The Australian Financial Review reported this week four former National Australia Bank executives including Stuart Stoyan are planning to raise $5 million in capital for their new venture MoneyPlace.ìThe space is heating up,"" Stoyan said. It is not hard to see why the sector is causing so much excitement. Peer-to-peer lenders ñ which match borrowers and lenders directly through online platforms ñ tick all the right boxes for speculative investors seeking the next disruptive technology. Not only do P2Ps feed off public mistrust of the big banks but they are operating at a time when interest rates around the world are low. They are able to offer borrowers ñ usually small players ignored by risk-averse banks ñ more competitive rates because their costs are generally much lower than the established financial institutions. And they appeal to a new generation of consumers who prefer the simplicity of online commerce. Furthermore, the big financial institutions have been slow to react to the competitive threat, although it should be noted Westpac Banking Corporation is a shareholder in SocietyOne.Good and bad timingFaes is familiar with many of the main players. He has visited Lending Clubís offices in San Francisco and met with SocietyOneís founders. A former property lawyer with Allens Arthur Robinson in Brisbane and the Gold Coast, Faes moved to London for a second time in 2008 to set up Montello Bridging Finance, a firm offering short-term mortgage lending. The timing could not have been worse. Within months the global financial crisis had flattened Londonís finance industry, leaving Montello with ìno investors while the world was falling apart"".  But starting in the midst of an unprecedented credit crunch did have its advantages. Once the firm was able to attract some backers, there was no shortage of opportunities to lend. A mortgage fund (unusual in the UK) was established in early 2010. But despite this the business still lacked scale. This desire to grow prompted the partners to consider P2P lending.ìSome of those early entrants such as Zopa were offering investors returns that were pretty low ñ about 4 or 5 per cent,"" Faes says. The loans on offer were generally of the unsecured consumer variety such as someone looking to consolidate their credit cards or buy a second hand car. They were also the type of loans high street banks generally avoided. ìThey were doing it in a very safe way as they were using sophisticated credit assessment and all the rest of it,"" Faes says. ìBut at the same time we thought we are lending against real estate and giving investors 8 per cent. So thatís when we started to get quite excited about peer-to-peer.""  Faes and his co-founder Ian Thomas were already regulars at drinks functions in east Londonís trendy technology hub known as Silicon Roundabout. They had been thinking about investing in a start-up on the side. Instead, they decided to do their own. LendInvest went live in May 2013. Faes admits they went into the new venture a ìlittle bit half-heartedly"" but now describes their position as ìall in"".ìWhat was really apparent really quickly was the huge investor appetite,"" he says. ìThe whole theme of P2P is investors wanting to take control of their investments. People are disenchanted with fund managers. Even people who invested in our mortgage funds are now using our platform, which is really perverse. They donít want to pay us to manage their investment. They want to do it themselves. In a sense we have disintermediated ourselves.""LendInvest provides landlords with short-term loans of up to three years. Much of the application process is done online but real people are still used to help assess the properties. A borrower can get their loan approved in two weeks in some cases (much quicker than the big banks) and expect to pay between 8 and 12 per cent, which is quite expensive given official interest rates are less than 1 per cent. More than £180 million has been invested in loans through LendInvest, making it the fourth-largest P2P in the UK. In January last year a London property developer used LendInvest to secure what was then the worldís largest P2P loan, worth £4 million. A sexier imageOne of the longer-term goals for LendInvest is to get into straight homeowner mortgages. Faes believes it is only a matter of time before applications for mortgages are made wholly online. This is not possible in the UK because of the risks of assessing people without seeing the whites of their eyes.But Faes says his visit to Lending Club exposed him to the possibilities of identification technology such software that assesses whether English is your first language or standard of education just by the way you type. ìYou can almost get to the point where someone has finished an online mortgage application and you can really price that effectively for risk based on the answers theyíve given and how theyíve done that,"" he says. Much of the technology LendInvest is developing is aimed at fraud prevention, including software that can check for false passports or trace mobile phones to check if a potential borrower is where they are meant to be. Mortgage fraud is not uncommon in the UK, where there are horror stories featuring tenants of unencumbered real estate assuming the identities of their landlords then selling the property. A high-profile default could do serious damage to the business, if not the broader industry. Several Chinese P2Ps were shut down in 2013 when borrowers failed to pay back loans, and there are fears the same could happen in the West when interest rates rise. LendInvest has 35 employees including another Gold Coast-exile, David Serafini, who took up the role of chief operating officer after a stint with the Royal Bank of Scotlandís IT division in the UK. Faes, who is 37, hopes to double the workforce in a year. But LendInvest initially struggled to attract technology experts because financial services is not as sexy as other start-ups involved in social media, retail or music. ìTheyíd come in with ripped jeans and T-shirts and their first reaction was ëI donít want to work for a finance company,í_"" Fraes says. ìSo hopefully we are changing that."" Government backingLendInvest has stayed away from Silicon Roundabout. But it did move from the city at the start of 2014 to an open-plan office not far from Regentís Park. There are not many T-shirts or ripped jeans on display but it does not appear anyone is wearing a tie either. While most of the other leading British P2Ps have raised capital from venture capital firms, LendInvest has managed to remain self-funded because it has always been profitable.P2P platforms rely on the trust of investors and having a sustainable amount of loans. But the growth of the UK market also has a lot to do with the role of government. Forced to shrink their balance sheets after the GFC, big banks were understandably reluctant to write riskier loans to individuals or small businesses. This represented a problem for the Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron, whose chances at this yearís election mostly rest on the strength of the UKís post-GFC recovery.Faes says he would rather emulate SocietyOneís relationship with Westpac. ìWe are evolving into a tech business but at the same time we want to be a sustainable financial services business.""As a result the government backed P2Ps. It was a politically advantageous move given it could be sold as encouraging competition for the big banks and supporting tech entrepreneurship. This backing includes allowing P2Ps to be included in Britainís individual savings account scheme (comparable to self-managed super funds in Australia) this year. In the previous Isa scheme, only cash and shares were allowed. The British Business Bank, a government body, has invested about £200 million through seven P2P lending platforms.ìToo much business lending is concentrated in the big banks and, if weíre to have a properly functioning business lending market, they need to be challenged by new banks, peer-to-peer lenders and other alternative providers,"" the UK business secretary, Vince Cable, has said. Faes cannot see the same level of support happening in Australia. The Murray Report acknowledged the growth of crowdfunding and P2P ≠lending, recommending ìgraduate ≠fundraising regulation to facilitate crowdfunding for both debt and equity and, over time, other forms of financing"".It is a response Swinburne University of Technologyís senior accounting and finance lecturer Vijaya Thyil describes as a ìslow and steady approach"".Faes agrees. ìThe UK got hit a lot harder than Australia so they have seen the crisis as an opportunity to reset the system, whereas in Australia it sailed through the crisis so it seems there is no political will to make big changes.""";social economy;http://www.afr.com/business/peertopeer-lending-takes-on-the-big-banks-20150123-12ww8x

484;As U.K. policymakers continue to make headway in reforms that strengthen small businessesí access to financing, the nationís peer-to-peer lending sector has made significant headway. Earlier this year, the Peer-to-Peer Finance Association revealed 2015 Q1 statistics that found a new high of $709 million that has been lent out through P2P lending platforms, with a significant share of this funding going straight to SME borrowers.But last week, researchers found that this lending market is growing even further. Reports published Friday (July 17) revealed that the U.K. P2P lending market experienced a record-breaking quarter in Q2 2015, with more than $792 million worth of P2P loans being handed out in the period by the end of June. The data was released by the Peer-to-Peer Finance Association as well.According to reports, the numbers represent a diversifying market of business models when it comes to alternative lenders. While the top two leading P2P lenders in the quarter were Zopa and Ratesetter, both consumer lending sites, the third-largest lender was a business lending platform, Funding Circle.ìWe have passed yet another milestone with our members facilitating over half a billion pounds of new loans in the last three months ó at this rate we may hit £4 billion [$6.24 billion] by the New Year,î said Peer-to-Peer Finance Association Chair Christine Farnish in a statement. ìStrong growth continues across all parts of the market, reflecting the increasing trust that both lending consumers and borrowers have in peer-to-peer lending platforms.îAccording to the data, P2P lending has more than 116,00 lenders in the U.K. market, with nearly 189,000 borrowers, both individuals and businesses.Reports highlighted the data in respect to policymakersí latest announcement that involves the industry.

485;"Interest rates have been at a record low of 0.5% for more than four years and that has meant a paltry rate of return for many savers.So instead of putting their money into a bank or building society, some have turned to an alternative way of investing their money, known as peer-to-peer lending.Also called social lending, this allows savers to lend directly to individuals or businesses looking to borrow money. It often provides a better return than they would get with their bank, but there are greater risks involved and less protection for their investment.

David Black, of the information firm Consumer Intelligence, points out that there is one major guarantee missing from these peer-to-peer lending schemes.""You need to be aware that your funds are not covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme and also there is the potential of bad debts,"" he says.This means that these schemes do not have the same protection as savers with UK-registered banks, building societies and credit unions. Under the FSCS, the first £85,000 of their funds per person per institution are protected if it goes bust.Mr Black believes that the sector is trying to address this shortfall.""Some of the schemes do have a safeguard provision fund to cover some of the bad debts. It is also worth bearing in mind that until next year they are not covered by the regulatory authorities,"" he said.'Phenomenal growth'The peer-to-peer lending sector is growing fast. Christine Farnish, of the Peer 2 Peer Finance Association, believes there is still more growth to come.""I think they are just scratching the surface of the potential market at the moment. They are growing at about 250% a year, which is pretty phenomenal,"" she says.A recent study by innovation charity Nesta suggests the sector has the potential to account for £12.3bn of loans a year.But Mr Black warns that this does not mean every scheme will be a success.""There are a number of smaller players that have ceased training. So it is a competitive business and not all of them will make it,"" he says.So, for those tempted to invest in a peer-to-peer lending scheme, how good an investor do you need to be?The Nesta study concludes that the typical saver who put money into these schemes was ""highly educated and relatively wealthy"" but Mr Hallwood believes anyone can do it and it will not take up all their time.""It is actually quite fun looking at these businesses and investing in them. If I look at the time I'm spending on this a week, it is probably an hour, perhaps two hours at most,"" he says.";social economy;http://www.bbc.com/news/business-22401744
486;Lack of trust and confidence in the high street banks has led to millions of customers shunning the big boys and heading to social lending websites.Whether you want to find a home for your savings or you need to borrow, there are now a number of interesting new alternatives.We have taken a closer look at some of the ìnew kids on the blockî to find out exactly what is on offer and what you need to look out for.Favourable ratesWeíve checked how the interest rates stack up against those offered on the high street as well as sifting through the small print to make sure you understand the benefits as well as any potential pitfalls of the new schemes.These new internet-based providers give savers, who are known as lenders, and borrowers a chance to get a better deal than they could get with their traditional bank. Because they operate their business online, peer-to-peer providers donít have the ≠overheads of running a huge network of branches, and because their costs are lower, they are able to pass some of these cost savings on to their customers.Savers have had to put up with rock-bottom interest rates for more than four years and in the past couple of months the ≠situation has become even worse.Six months ago, you could have received 3.60% on a one-year, fixed rate bond, now you need to lock your money away for four or five years to bag that sort of return.However, if you look at the returns on offer from the likes of Zopa, ≠RateSetter and Funding Circle in the tables below, it is easy to see why increasing numbers of people are giving the banks a wide berth. You donít have to have a huge sum of cash to become a peer-to-peer lender ñ with Zopa and RateSetter you can invest from just £10 and with Funding Circle you can start from just £20.This alternative banking concept is no soft touch ñ strict credit scoring criteria is vital to ensure defaults are kept to a minimum to give people confidence to continue to deposit their savings with the peer-to-peer firms.RateSetter, for example, says that only 10-15% of loan ≠applications are approved, so while it may offer a simpler and fairer way to borrow money, if you donít have an excellent credit profile you will have to go elsewhere.It is not just personal banking customers that are looking for new ways to borrow: small business owners are increasingly turning to sources such as Funding Circle as borrowing from their local bank has become far more difficult and, for those that do meet the strict lending criteria, the cost of borrowing is too expensive.One of the main concerns with people depositing their cash with peer- to-peer providers is that, although the returns far outweigh those paid by the banks, they donít offer the ≠cast-iron guarantee to savers that ≠ordinary bank customers enjoy under the ≠Financial Services Compensation Scheme. Peer-to-peer providers have their own methods of trying to limit the risk to depositors.Zopa, for example, will spread your money among a wide range of borrowers, whereas RateSetter adopts a different approach by operating a ìprovision fundî that is built up from borrower fees, and ≠reimburses lenders in the case of late payment or default.Managing riskAs these providers grow and become more established, they will gain the confidence and trust of bigger numbers of people and will offer up a viable ≠alternative that will have the big boys of the high street on the run.If the rates remain competitive and bad debt levels are ≠maintained at the current low levels, the peer-to-peer industry could soon become the preferred choice for many more savvy savers. But there are potential risks to examine before you decide if peer-to-peer is the right option for you.If you deposit your money in a traditional savings account with your bank or building society, your balance (up to a maximum of £85,000 per person, per provider) is protected under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme should your bank or building society go bust.Customers using peer-to-peer providers do not receive the protection of the FSCS.However, each of the providers have their own way of managing the risks.If you intend using a peer-to-peer provider to get a better deal on your savings, it is important that you fully understand this and are comfortable with the methods that these providers use to safeguard your cash.We got funding for our hotelFather-of-two Nigel Williams, 49, from Llandudno, is the fourth ≠generation of his family to run the Ambassador Hotel.ìWe approached our bank for the finance to help us with some ≠refurbishments to the hotel, but despite being customers for more than 10 years, our application was turned down flat,î he explains. ìIt was so frustrating and we felt totally let down. We approached Funding Circle for the £30,000 we needed for the project and were really pleased with the efficient, no-nonsense service and the low interest rate.ìThey ran a full and thorough check of our business finances, but the process was straightforward and the loan was agreed very quickly.î;social economy;http://www.mirror.co.uk/money/personal-finance/social-lending-peer-peer-loans-1438349
487;"After all, the internet has seen its fair share of nasties from phishing e-mails posing as a bank to key logging software pinching our passwords and personal information, all in an effort to steal our identity and cash. But now there is a wave of sites trying to convince people that the web is the place for their money. The concept is called social lending and the idea is to introduce people who need money to people who want to lend some - cutting out the middlemen like banks and mortgage companies. Zopa is a pioneer in this space. For the past two years it has allowed members to borrow and lend on their own terms. Alison Daniel is an HR Advisor at a magazine publishing company who was looking for a loan to pay her overdraft. ""I looked at my bank and other various banks where I could get a loan and then I heard about Zopa, went on to their online calculator and the rates came up really cheaply so I opted for Zopa,"" she said. The site itself is very easy to use. After both the borrower and the lender have registered, they choose what rate at which they would like to borrow or lend. If the rate they choose corresponds then the site brings them together.    You do feel a connection to the people you are loaning to Jane BennettLender, Kiva  But how trustworthy is the site and will lenders get their money back? James Alexander, CEO of Zopa says they do everything they can to minimise any risk. ""We risk assess, identity and credit check every individual that comes to Zopa,"" he said. ""So it's a community of known individuals and what Zopa does is connect these people so they can borrow and lend money on their own terms."" To minimize risk Zopa will spread your loan among a few borrowers. So if are lending £500 ($993) then your money will automatically go to 50 different people. Banker to the poor So think of Zopa like eBay for money, and like eBay, there are still risks involved in trading. But social lending is not just for people looking for a material gain, it can also be an easy way to give a helping hand to those most in need. The social lending site Kiva allows lenders to give to a specific entrepreneur in a poor or developing world country.  Bicycle wheel Social lending enabled Angel Isaev to start a cycle business  One person who has been helped by the site is Angel Isaev from Bulgaria. Two years ago, he decided to open up his own bicycle repair business after losing his job at a local shop that closed down. And to make this dream come true he needed cash. ""At the beginning I was a very, very poor boy,"" said Mr Isaev. ""Then I was told about Kiva, and with their help I was able to fulfil my dream; I was able to prove I'm a businessman."" For a minimum loan of $25 (£13) Kiva allows people to sponsor a business by choosing from thousands of cases detailed online. Mr Isaev's lender Jane Bennett says an attractive feature of Kiva is that she can see who she is lending to. ""There are certainly occasions when I am looking to see who I am going loan money to and I would like to loan to them all because it is just amazing to see the stories of these people and how they are getting on with their lives,"" she said. ""You do feel a connection to the people you are loaning to and I think it is because you see a picture of them and find out a bit about their life."" Throughout the period of the loan - usually six to 12 months - sponsors receive e-mail updates about how borrowers are getting on as they repay their loan. This sort of scheme is generally called Microfinance. It is not new, but the web's ability to allow anyone to become a banker to the world's poor certainly is. Currency exchange And the web is also turning other established financial models on their head, such as currency exchange. FXA World is the world's first peer-to-peer currency exchange where you can trade your foreign currency at a rate that you have set or at the rate the banks trade among themselves. The site will offer you two options: Instant Challenge will give you the best rate available from a peer at any given time, or you can place an eBay-style listing where you can choose your rate and wait for someone else who is happy to trade. Sites like this give more choice to users in deciding what they do with their money. So, is social lending set to be the next big thing? ""They are what we call a niche mass,"" explained social lending expert Professor Michael Hulme of Lancaster University. ""In other words, it is likely that there will be a growing market but not a market that replaces financial services and high street banking and stuff like that";social economy;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/click_online/6623267.stm
488;"Hey! Iíve got this great idea. We persuade lots of people to put money into a pot, and then we lend it out to other people who need money, at interest. Of course, we make sure the borrowers are good citizens and repay the money. And we keep a little for ourselves!That must have been roughly how the conversations ran in the coffee shops of Shoreditch and Brooklyn when tech whizzkids were dreaming up peer-to-peer lending. And, for that matter, in medieval Florence and Genoa when they were founding the first banks.Remarkably, the P2P crowd have pulled off the coup of making their crop of platforms seem like something completely new.It isnít, of course. But amid the wreckage of the financial crisis, everyone ó from private savers and entrepreneurs to politicians and regulators ó has been happy to listen to the idea that peer-to-peer lending is a ìnew modelî for retail and small business finance. Especially when it comes with no baggage of past sins, stylish websites and hip names like Zopa and Lending Club.There are, it is true, many varieties of bank. Among the variables are how much care the bank (or platform) takes about choosing its borrowers; how readily investors can withdraw their money; and how the intermediator is paid.But the starting point for understanding peer-to-peer lenders has to be a recognition that they are banks.How do they differ from traditional banks? Most obviously, they are a lot smaller, have little or no capital and are much more lightly regulated. Happy with that? If not, read no further ó put your money somewhere else.Cutting out the middlemanAmong the earliest claims was that P2P platforms could bypass sclerotic, unnecessary and inefficient banking bureaucracies and connect lenders directly with borrowers.One of the attractions was, and with some platforms still is, the idea that you could know where your money was going ó in some cases, as P2P shades into crowdfunding ó the precise name and details of the business, person or project being funded.With equity investments this is usually desired, and even with loans it has an attraction. It makes lending more fun if you know where your money is going. And this remains a true and valid aspect of some P2P finance platforms.To the extent that lenders know where their specific money is going, P2P does offer something different from banking, which can help to attract funds from certain kinds of investor.But this comes with a huge increase in risk. Diversification is the first way to reduce investment risk ó and giving it up means you stand to lose big chunks of your money if things go wrong. Linking lender to borrower directly also means the lender cannot withdraw his or her money until the borrower chooses to repay.Reinventing the wheelIt was to solve these problems that modern banks evolved. By pooling all the money from savers into all the loans, risk is shared, making it much more predictable, while savers can move money in and out, as long as the bank retains confidence. Add a layer of ownersí capital and it can do that.Another claim for P2P is that their technology is superior to the banksí, enabling them to make loans better or more efficiently. But ever since the internet took off 15 years ago, banks have offered loans online in a matter of minutes, to anyone who can fill out a brief questionnaire, prove their identity, credit history and so on. So P2P platforms are not new there. Where they may depart from the banks is by having looser standards.The veil slipsP2P lenders have tried to pretend they are different from banks, but the pretence is wearing thin. Most now split each saverís money up among a pool of loans, even if those are still identifiable. Fundraising is no longer just from individuals ó institutional money has buzzed to the honeypot, whether through direct investments, securitization or even bank involvement, like Santanderís partnership with Funding Circle in the UK.Never has the illusion of novelty been allowed to slip more than with Wellesleyís announcement today of a retail bond issue, to be listed in Dublin and offered to UK savers through an Individual Savings Account, which allows you to invest up to £15,000 a year tax-free.The three and five year bonds pay 4% and 5.25% ó substantially more than the highest yielding fixed rate savings bonds of equivalent maturities listed by Moneysupermarket.com, offered by lenders such as Maltaís AgriBank.Wellesley claims to be the UKís fastest growing P2P lender, having made £165m of secured loans, often for property development. And it proudly notes: ìThe firm is also the only Peer-to-Peer lender to lend its own funds into every loan and will take the first loss if a borrower fails to meet loan repayments. Additionally, all lender funds are evenly distributed into every loan and therefore maximum diversification is guaranteed to all investors regardless of size.îIn other words ó ëtrust us, we are like a bankí. The pitch goes on: ìWellesley has recently added increased visibility on its website on its total Financial Resources, including its provision fund, which is seen as a ësafety bufferí in front of all of its P2P lenders and a potential loss. The firm currently quotes that it has in excess of £9m of financial resources available.îIn other words, a capital ratio of 5.4%.Mini-banks?Thatís better than Barclays, which had £1.37tr of assets at its last results, supported by £68bn of regulatory capital, £60bn of shareholdersí equity or £47bn of tier one capital ó ratios of 5% to 3.4%, depending on how you look at it.But unlike Barclays, Wellesley is not obliged to maintain its capital ratio, and its assets are a lot less diverse. Some other P2P lenders do not even make such claims.Wellesley may have found a good model for P2P lending but everything the firm is proud of about this makes it more like an ordinary bank.And judged by that standard, it is a small, undiversified, recently founded, unreliably capitalised and unregulated bank.That is a microcosm of P2P as a whole. They are small, primitive banks with very little oversight.The new subprimeThere is definitely a place for peer-to-peer lending. It is fresh and it suits some borrowers ó just like the subprime lending markets that were its immediate forerunner.P2P also offers savers higher returns than old-line banks. There are at least six possible reasons for that: P2P is genuinely more efficient (unlikely, given banksí massive experience, high use of technology and economies of scale); its equity investors are less greedy for returns (possible, but unlikely to be sustainable); there is less equity to be fed (yes); it is making riskier loans (almost certainly true, since higher return tends to follow higher risk and there is much less diversification); some of the borrowers are lazy and find it easier to borrow from a P2P lender, even if this costs more (possible, but not inspiring); and finally, that there are genuinely good risks out there that the banks, through their own rigidities, are missing or mispricing.The last is certainly possible, even likely, and is the reason why P2P should be permitted, as an alternative to regulated banks.The future: small and fun or big and boringRetail savers should not be mollycoddled. If they are allowed to invest in shares, why not in loans? Risk-taking can be good for the economy. But investors must be open-eyed about what they are getting into, and ready to bear the losses if it goes wrong.Governments and regulators should be very wary of extending any cloak of official protection or endorsement to P2P, such as including it in compensation schemes. It would be quite wrong to guarantee deposits in these unregulated firms.And if P2P ever becomes big enough to matter ó so that its collapse would actually damage the economy ó it will have to be regulated. This will have to be bank regulation, as the platforms are functionally banks.";social economy;http://www.globalcapital.com/article/qcdzwh8h5n9s/peer-to-peer-lenders-are-banks-without-capital-or-regulation
489;"A debt or a loan was initially intended to bridge the temporary shortfall in money when one needed it and which was subsequently repaid back over a period of time with interest. Over time debt has become a complex financial product and especially in a country like India, has proved to be ""deadly"".An image not far from the truth, movies often portrayed money lenders as someone who was ready to squeeze your life to get his abnormally high interest on the money he lent out. Very soon bankers joined the list of being universally hated - not because people hate returning interest, but because moneylenders and bankers have always extracted more than their fair share from the borrowers.Consider this - despite two rate cuts in 2015, about 70 banks in the country has still not cut their interest rates and not passed on the benefits to the customers. Interest rates in the country are high and opaque and the poor are often left fending for themselves. Farmers riddled with high debt and interest rates have been committing suicide for years now. A business transaction cannot lead to deaths and if it does, it would mean we have a serious problem in hand and the system is broken.A high interest rate would have been understandable if banks worked on thin margins and were under cost pressure. On the other hand, we have the vast majority of banks and lending institutions making super natural profits. To give an example the top 10 bank in India have an average profit margin of 30% and have been growing at over 25% for last 10 years.Banks in the country are monopolistic in manner and the Reserve Bank of India has had to repeatedly arm twist them to keep them aligned with the monetary policy. While the world is reaping benefits of technology innovation in the financial sector, banks are ambivalent to efficiency and happy with the status quo of high interest rates and low deposit rate.What ails? Cost and access an issue:In India, borrowers face two pronged problem - firstly that of access and secondly that of cost. In access it is both physical access to banks and financial institutions. The other problem of access is less talked about but very pronounced. Even if a borrower has a good credit history, banks may not lendbecause they are from a particular community, profession or residing in a particular area.The access to bank credit is also a major issue for SMEs and self-employed professionals as banks have an asset based underwriting mechanism. India is, however, primarily a services economy, which means most businesses are asset light.Even where there is access the other big challenge is cost of fund. In India there is monopoly with no new bank licences been given in the last 10 years (only last year RBI gave license to two banks). The banks have had no reason to reinvent themselves or be competitive. They have relied on the same old underwriting models with one size fits all. Banks charge similar interest rates and the differentiator is service rather than cost advantage.The story on the depositor side is even worse the deposit rates are more or less the same across banks. In the name of investor protection no financial institution other than banks can raise public deposits. There is complete monopoly of banks as far as deposits are concerned.Then there is the problem of the other India that never got banked and still relies on para-banking, community lending and chit funds for their credit needs. These non-institutional lending businesses have been carrying on for generations with very little or no documentation based purely on trust.However, today peer-to-peer lending marketplaces like ours and others in the field are working on both the issues Cost and Access. They are reinventing banking and disinter-mediating banks. The information war:What makes the banks what they are? Some say they have the institutional muscle to recover debt, while others say they have access to cheap capital. The reality is that they had access to information, which before this was only available to them. They had access to information which needed large investments, which an individual could never make.Today with the data and information being freely available it is no longer the preserve of the large institutions .There is democratization of data and information. There are new sets of information that even banks are not using,which are not only accessible to everyone, but also come at a fraction of the cost.The works:There are three levels of democratization of information - firstly at the generation, secondly at the dissemination and thirdly at the integration or aggregation level. The data is being generated and disseminated simultaneously at multiple levels, be it social footprint or financial transactions that captures consumer behaviour. This information is then aggregated in real time by the new age financial technology companies.";social economy;http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2015-05-05/news/61833446_1_banks-interest-access
490;At a recent disruptersí conference, Stuart Stoyan, founder of P2P lender MoneyPlace, initially evoked memories of ANZ chief executive Mike Smithís famous 2012 lament that regulators have no natural predators, saying his companyís biggest concern was regulation.Then came the sting.ìThereís not enough of it,î Mr Stoyan said to his Finsia (Financial Services Institute of Australasia) audience.ìOur biggest fear is a major failure by a P2P lender, or a company claiming to be one, that causes ASIC or another agency to come in and say: ëWeíre shutting this downí.îEven in the fledgling P2P lending industry, MoneyPlace is a relative newcomer.Currently self-funded, the start-up expects to close out a $2 million to $2.5m capital raising from professional investors in the next month or so, ahead of securing an Australian Financial Services Licence in August that would enable it to start lending.It would then join the likes of first-mover SocietyOne ó which has among its backers News Corp, James Packerís Consolidated Press and Kerry Stokesís Australian Capital ó and RateSetter, which is the local version of the largest P2P lender in Europe.The target in Australia for these groups is the spectacular margins earned by legacy banks in the consumer lending market.Despite central banks flattening global interest rates through massive bond-buying programs, credit card rates have remained extravagantly high, resulting in last yearís record spread of more than 17 per cent over a standard term deposit.Consumer lending accounts for only 3 per cent of total loans but the segment delivers 7 per cent of industry profits and 11 per cent of risk-adjusted earnings.The P2P model disrupts the banks by directly connecting investors and borrowers through an online platform, with the savings invested in more attractive interest rates at both ends of the transaction.The problem with honey pots, though, is that they can attract main-chancers keen to mimic the eight-year-old Lending Club, which became the 14th largest ìbankî in the US with a $US9bn valuation after its December initial public offering.In China, however, the P2P lending boom is rapidly turning to bust. Of the countryís circa-1000 platforms, 58 collapsed in the last quarter of 2014, amid complaints about breakneck expansion and poor regulatory oversight.Mr Stoyan, who spent a decade at management consultants Accenture and Bain before three years at National Australia Bank, most recently as strategy chief in business banking, is intent on ensuring that Australia avoids the same experience.Heís complimentary about ASICís determination to come to grips with P2P lending, and the level of interest shown at commissioner level and by chairman Greg Medcraft.The MoneyPlace chief also backed the watchdogís decision to regulate lenders as managed investment schemes that require an AFSL.ìBut the challenge for ASIC is a lack of resourcing and its ability to respond quickly, because as other people see the opportunity you might start to get less reputable players, like in the payday lending industry,î Mr Stoyan said.Discussions were already in progress about the establishment of an industry association, which would settle on a clear definition of P2P lending.The threshold test was likely to be the operation of a genuine marketplace to match borrowers with investors. This would exclude the operators that are seeking some P2P gloss, when all they really do is run a balance sheet online.In recent weeks, ASIC has taken action against DirectMoney, delaying its planned listing to tomorrow by forcing the company to issue a supplementary prospectus. Among the regulatorís concerns were the companyís description of its business model, its claimed valuation and DirectMoneyís level of security given a December-quarter fraud attack that resulted in a bad debt write-off of almost $400,000, or 11.8 per cent of the companyís year-end loan balance of $3.3m.In response, the company said it had ìrestructuredî its credit team and put in place comprehensive anti-fraud measures, with no subsequent losses experienced.DirectMoney also withdrew a $39m valuation in its prospectus, noting a post-transaction, independent expertís valuation of $14.7m.It clarified, as well, that equity investors would bear the losses from early defaults, because loans were only sold to outside investors from an internal warehouse after a 30-day period.While MoneyPlaceís business model is simpler than DirectMoneyís, consumer education is still a big challenge for the whole P2P industry. For starters, the industry escapes the ever-growing demands on banks for deeper, loss-absorbing capital buffers, and there are some superficial parallels between the collateralised debt obligations that blew up in the financial crisis and the fractionalised exposure to consumer loans offered in the P2P model.The fundamental difference is that, unlike banking, thereís no leverage in P2P lending ó if you invest $1 you get a $1 exposure to loans.Fractionalisation also reduces risk by enabling investment in a diversified portfolio of loans at minimal cost.The big risk with CDOs, which were a highly leveraged exposure to US housing loans, was a collapse in US house prices.With P2P, on the other hand, the main thing to worry about is a severe recession causing double-digit unemployment and a wave of defaults on unsecured consumer lending.ìInvestors would have the exposure to the risk of default, and the way we mitigate that is to have responsible lending practices to ensure there is serviceability, and we stress-test that,î Mr Stoyan said.ìIf you look overseas, Lending Club and Prosper survived in the US, and Zopa in the UK.ìTheyíre legitimate and robust businesses, albeit with a different model to a bank.ìBut if there were a recession, weíre confident MoneyPlace could weather the storm.î;social economy;http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/financial-services/p2p-lenders-want-more-regulation-not-less/story-fn91wd6x-1227429559753
491;"China's banking regulator is considering tighter oversight of the booming online peer-to-peer (P2P) lending business, including setting a high capital requirement that is likely to push hundreds of players out of the market.According to three officials with knowledge of the matter, the China Banking Regulatory Commission is considering a minimum capital requirement of 30 million yuan for online platforms operating P2P businesses.The changes would also mean the total value of loans extended by the P2P platforms with their own capital cannot exceed 10 times their registered capital.It is expected that the changes will take effect in the second half of this year as part of the regulator's efforts to contain the wild growth of P2P lending, the latest entrant to the country's shadow banking system.""A credit crisis arising from the P2P model is nearly inevitable, given the present high default rate,"" said Yang Chongyi, the chief risk officer at Chengdui Financial Information. ""It is estimated that 10 per cent of the P2P loans are either overdue or have become non-performing assets.""China has about 2,000 P2P lending platforms that serve as matchmakers for cash-hungry businesses and cash-rich investors. Most of the P2P businesses offer loans valued at less than 100,000 yuan to individuals and small businesses. The annualised borrowing costs when using P2P platforms are about 20 per cent.Last year, 250 P2P businesses collapsed with about one-third of them involved in some kind of fraud, said Sun Zhanping, the general manager of ChinaPay e-Payment Service.State-owned commercial banks in China are reluctant to grant loans to small firms, which have to resort to underground banks or the P2P model to borrow money for their operations.The formerly illegal underground banking practices were rampant in Wenzhou, Zhejiang province, until a credit crisis in 2011 caused dozens of people, including borrowers and operators of loan-sharking schemes, to either commit suicide or flee the country.In 2013, P2P lending gained ground in the country as hundreds of entrepreneurs jumped on to the bandwagon of internet finance, using technology and analysis of ""big data"" to offer online financial services, encouraged by government plans to reform the financial system.However, China still lacks clear-cut rules governing online financial services. Currently, the CBRC bans P2P companies from raising funds and providing guarantee services for borrowers.A majority of existing players would fail to qualify if the capital requirement of 30 million yuan were to take effect.Last week, 354 firms including Lufax.com, a P2P platform run by a unit of Ping An Insurance (Group), were put on a ""blacklist"" by rating agency Dagong Global Credit Rating, which cited concerns including the failure to disclose debtor information.Lufax said in a statement that the negative rating on the company was unsubstantiated.Its competitors also pushed back on the ""blacklisting"".""Lufax is relatively strong among P2P businesses while it is still questioned by the rating agency,"" said Qiu Jianfeng, the chairman of jyc99.com, another online P2P platform.

492;Squirrel Money, New Zealandís leading challenger in the mortgage broking market, introduces New Zealandís first true peer-to-peer (P2P) lending service.Squirrel Money connects real lenders with real borrowers in a way New Zealand hasnít seen be-fore.Finally, smart investors who want a decent rate of return in a secure environment will be able to connect with real borrowers in an online environment that takes the hassle out of the whole pro-cess.Managing Director John Bolton says heís excited to introduce an authentic P2P service.ìOther offerings are really just marketing campaigns for the very banks weíre disrupting. Squirrel Money is about connecting borrowers with real lenders, not banks or finance houses.îThe benefits for both are obvious, says Bolton.ìLenders have more security, more control and for first-time lenders, itís a great introduction to the market. ìFor borrowers we can offer sharper interest rates and an online model that makes the whole pro-cess easier and more straightforward than ever before.îBorrowing rates are determined by an auction-style bidding process. The more investors that join an auction, the lower the rates on offer, and vice versa. Because we have a flat fee structure re-turns arenít eaten up by hidden costs and percentages,î says Bolton.Squirrel Money charges $250 for unsecured loans and $500 for secured.     Bolton says the time is right for Squirrel Money as investors are keen to see their money work harder for them.ìMost investments are either high risk for potentially higher return, or low risk for very low return. This puts off a lot of potential investors from entering the market. Here at Squirrel Money we want to balance that risk and return and make life easier for someone to lend money and to get their money back when they need it.îSquirrel Moneyís transactions are protected by Loan Shield - a reserve fund that covers unex-pected credit loss.The software that makes Squirrel Money so easy to use was designed and built in New Zealand.ìWeíre using our own designers and developers to build the app and thatís meant weíre able to make the changes we want, to build an app that works for New Zealanders.î says Bolton.;social economy;http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/BU1511/S00015/real-peer-to-peer-lending-arrives-in-new-zealand.htm
493;"Thereís a new peer-to-peer lender on the block, known simply as Lending Crowd. The new P2P start-up will open for business later this year and will be the first in New Zealand to offer SMEs business loans to a maximum of $200,000.Along with business finance it also aims to shake up vehicle finance and provide an alternative for personal loans.Functioning much the same as other P2P companies, Lending Crowd is an online platform where people who want to borrow are matched with those who want to lend or invest. It bypasses banks and aims to provide better interest rates and more individualised loans for both borrowers and lenders.Wayne Croad, Lending Crowd managing director, says the product is based on years of experience in the offline management of borrowing and private lending.""Weíve looked extremely hard at what really matters to borrowers and investors in New Zealand and have built Lending Crowd with the prime focus of driving down the cost of borrowing money.""The flip side is investors know that all borrowers have skin in the game, or security of an asset, thatís baked into all loans at inception,"" he says.Lending Crowdís P2P platform will manage loans of between $2,000 and $200,000, all secured by either a registered vehicle or vehicles, a second security of residential or commercial property, or a combination of both.""Weíre pleased to offer investors access to an investment asset class normally dominated by the big banks. In particular we believe the SME finance market is ripe for disruption,"" Croad says.""We know from experience business owners have a lot of frustration at the unnecessary bureaucracy when trying to access funds from big banks to purchase assets, obtain working capital or fund business expansion. Lending Crowd is aimed at easing this process,î he says.According to Croad, a key market ready for the disruptive forces of a P2P funded service is vehicle finance.""New Zealanders have traditionally obtained finance for cars, motorbikes and commercial vehicles directly through either a motor trader, broker, finance company or their bank.""But with new technology the traditional avenues of raising money are highly inefficient and cost New Zealanders millions of dollars every year.""Car dealers are only one sector that earns substantial commissions and are incentivised to clip the ticket by upselling higher interest rates to consumers,"" he says.On top of this, banks and other finance companies have a ëone interest rate fits allí approach to borrower risk, despite the fact that this is unsuitable for most, he says.Borrowers and investors are paying for increasing overhead structures, such as bank branches, and through inflated or deflated interest rates. According to Croad, these are ëcompletely unnecessaryí and essentially equate to ëexpensive billboardsí.""Using P2P, Lending Crowd pledges to offer crowd sourced money from like-minded people and institutions driving down interest rates with 100% transparency around fee structures.ìThis approach will result in substantially more money in the pockets of New Zealanders versus mainly overseas owned institutions,"" he says.Lending Crowd intends to launch with a special offer for people buying cars, motorbikes, trucks, caravans or any other vehicle with a registration number.On the stiff competition in the P2P space, Croad says Lending Crowd has years of knowledge and IP behind them.He says, the company evolved out of Finance Direct, a well-known independent national Non-Bank Deposit Taker (NBDT) with a 16 year history.""We see our heritage as a huge competitive advantage and a perfect platform from which to stir up disruptive change - after all you canít stop progress.""Our directors have successfully weathered economic ups and downs including the Global Financial Crisis. The result is we believe we have more hands-on expertise in credit and risk assessment than any other P2P player in New Zealand,î he says.Croad says pending a successful launch in New Zealand plans are already in place for expansion into Australia with trademarks secured.""Weíre delighted to have received our licence and are now looking forward to giving the finance and P2P market something new and different.""We have built a strong foundation from which to offer borrowers and investors the best deals, all delivered by a fully online and transparent process that people will feel good about using,"" he says.";social economy;https://bizedge.co.nz/story/new-peer-peer-lender-aims-shake-market/
494;"Lending Works - a peer-to-peer lender, has announced an improvement to its unique insurance protecting its lenders.The previous Lending Works Shield - an insurance policy protecting lendersí money against borrower defaults and fraud, has been improved to provide protection against an even greater range of risks affecting borrowersí ability to repay loans.All of the major reasons for borrower defaults such as accidents, illness, death and even loss of employment are now fully covered, giving lenders unparalleled peace of mind.The newly improved Shield will safeguard saversí funds, even in the event of another major economic crisis, where loan repayments will be harder to collect and arrears rates will rise.Having conducted research into over 2million personal loans written over the last five years, Lending Works, in conjunction with credit reference agency Equifax, found that even borrowers with above average credit scores have a one in 10 chance of missing at least one payment.Findings further show that in the event of a major economic downturn, simply relying on a reserve fund of 5% of a loan book alone would not suffice, meaning not all of the lendersí money would be repaid.Launched in January 2014, Lending Works has already provided its market-leading lender protection to over £3million worth of loans across the UK.Providing customers with very competitive rates for lenders over both three and five-year saving terms has allowed Lending Works to rank first or second on all major price comparison websites.The lenders tend to be first-time peer-to-peer lenders who lend through Lending Works due to its unique protection and competitive interest rates.Due to strong and growing demand for the safest possible peer-to-peer saving environment without sacrificing on competitive interest rates, Lending Works has increased its insurance - at no extra cost to the lender or borrower. The improved insurance is supplied by three of the UKís biggest names in insurance, all regulated by the FCA (Financial Conduct Authority) and the PRA (Prudential Regulation Authority).Nick Harding, CEO of Lending Works, commented: ""Instead of the government stepping in and taking regulation into its own hands, we believe it is our job to make our customers feel safe about saving with us.""We are very happy that so many customers already agree with us. We are very confident that the newly improved Lending Works Shield will enhance confidence in our product.""Without taking action, consumers will continue to worry about how safe investing in peer-to-peer is over a bank savings account. The improved Shield goes a long way towards providing lenders with extra peace of mind.""As interest in insurance backed peer-to-peer lending continues to increase, we have seen growth of over 30% in money saved on our platform month on month and we are on track to lend over £1million in November.""Having just completed 10 months since launch, Lending Works is now lending over £1million a month to borrowers.A typical borrower is between 30 to 40 years old with an average loan size of £4,200 over three years. Lenders are traditionally older and lend an average of £6,000 for five years, with average earnings of 4.3% annually over three years.Lending Worksí arrears and default rate on loans continues to be 0.00%. Should the global market derail again, lenders can rest assured that they have the Shield to protect them.";social economy;http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/special-features/making-peer-to-peer-lending-safer-firm-8103120
495;UBL is Pakistanís second largest private bank with more than 1,300 branches and 3 millionretail clients, assets of US$7.5 billion and a 10% market share of deposits (year end 2012).UBL had the vision of using mobile as a banking channel as early as 2005, when it first developeda mobile wallet (Orion). When the formal regulations for branchless banking were rolledout in 2008, UBL seized the opportunity to enhance its in-house technology platform and tolaunch a mobile money service, UBL Omni. The vision was to deepen the bankís reach beyondits existing retail customers, generate new revenues for UBL, create new business models andprovide financial services to low-income households.UBL Omni launched in early 2010, with a focus on G2P payments, first disbursing paymentsfor the World Food Programme (WFP) and then the Benazir Income Support Programme(BISP), a governmental programme for low-income women and their households. UBL Omniwas also able to facilitate emergency cash transfers to more than 1.2 million families affectedby the flood in 2010. In recognition of these projects, UBL Omni won the GSMA 2011 awardfor best use of mobile in a humanitarian crisis.Although UBL Omni offered a complete product suite from launch, the absence of a sizeabledistribution network was a barrier to adoption of the other products. The focus on G2P in theearly days allowed UBL the time to build a national distribution network. Today, the footprintis 13,000 strong, and supports a robust product offering: account opening and ATM cardissuance at retail locations, bill payments, airtime top-up, domestic money transfer, cashmanagement services for corporations, salary disbursements for SMEs, cash collection servicesfor charities and microfinance institutions and cash disbursement services for a host of UNagencies as well as Government of Pakistan.An estimated 3.5 million Pakistanis use UBL Omni every month, and do so through either theOTC model or through accounts via SMS, mobile app, ATM cards, IVR, and online.;Contactless Payment;GSMA - Mobile Money for unbanked - asia old
496;Today, mobile money services are available throughout much of the developing world.Most markets have a live offering and many have multiple services. In 2007, there werefewer than 20 mobile money services for the unbanked worldwide. Since then the numberof deployments has ballooned to over 190, with another 115 planning to launch.1How are these 190 services faring? Unevenly. Many mobile money services have yet toachieve significant scale, but a collection of stand-out services appear to have figured out theformula and are riding a steep growth trajectory. According to GSMAís 2012 Global MobileMoney Adoption Survey,2 14 services qualified as Mobile Money Sprinters, the worldís fastestgrowing mobile money services. What has been the formula for their success?A number of elements need to be in place for a mobile money service to become a sprinter,including an enabling regulatory environment, adequate levels of investment, strong marketing,and well-managed distribution networks. Over the past year, MMU has publishedcase studies that examine how certain mobile money services have managed to thrive incountries such as Zimbabwe, Pakistan and Somaliland. Together these case studies demonstratethat mobile money success is no longer the story of just one country or region, andby sharing these lessons with the industry, MMU hopes to accelerate the success of moremobile money services around the globe.MMU has also researched how a more enabling regulatory environment for mobile moneycame about in Sri Lanka and how Indonesian operators have managed to achieve interoperability.These examples offer valuable lessons that other industry players can apply in theirown markets to achieve greater financial inclusion.;Contactless Payment;GSMA - Mobile Money for unbanked - asia old
497;On May 15, 2013, Indonesiaís three major mobile operatorsóTelkomsel, Indosat andXLówent live with a ground-breaking initiative that enabled their mobile moneycustomers to send and receive money across each otherís networks. This was amilestone in the mobile money industry. for the first time, mobile money platformsrun by mobile operators could talk to each otheróaccount to account, or ìwalletto-walletîóin real time.In most countries with mobile money deployments, money sent to a customer on a differentmobile network generates a voucher that can only be cashed out at an agent in the senderísnetwork. Sending money ìoff-netî results in a cash-out, missing the opportunity to triggeradditional electronic transactions. Until recently, mobile money customers in Indonesiawere in the same boat.However, the three main operators in Indonesia announced a new development in May2013 to change this. Today, a mobile money customer can use the money in their e-walletnot only to pay a bill, buy airtime or transfer money to another customer in their network,but also to send money directly to an account, or m-wallet, in a mobile moneyscheme of another network.In this case study, MMU provides a snapshot of the implementation of mobile money interoperabilityin Indonesia--specifically, how it came to be that three independent mobile operatorsworked together to make real-time transfers across their mobile money deployments a reality.;Contactless Payment;GSMA - Mobile Money for unbanked - asia old
498;Mobile money transactions involve converting cash to electronic value, moving value between the accounts of individuals, businesses andgovernments, and converting electronic value back to cash. In general, mobile operators want to get money into the system as cheaplyas possible and have it rotate as many times as possible before exiting the system. Figure 2 maps the types of transactions in a mobilemoney system according to how value moves in, out, and within the system. Incoming transactionsIncoming flows of value come from cash-in, bulk payment disbursements (e.g., salary payments into mobile money accounts orgovernment-to-person payments), incoming international remittances, and transfers from the banking system or alternative mobileplatform to a mobile wallet.11Operators are usually willing to subsidise incoming transactions to stimulate customer usage. Value most frequently enters the systemas a cash-in through a mobile money agent, and although this transaction is usually free of charge for the customer, the provider paysthe agent a commission based on the value of the transaction. While agent commission structures vary significantly across markets, weestimate the average cost for a cash-in is approximately 0.7% of the transaction value. Bulk payments are a cheaper source of funds and,not surprisingly, the fastest growing transaction type for mobile money deployments globally.12 Direct transfers from the banking systemare another attractive source of funds, assuming a subset of customers is banked.Circulating valueValue circulating on a mobile money platform is primarily the result of on-net peer-to-peer transfers and payments (e.g., merchant payments,supply chain payments between businesses). These transactions do not result in net changes to the total value on the mobile money platform.All mobile money deployments strive to encourage value to circulate on their platforms. Value moving between different accountshosted on the same platform does not create transaction costs for the provider and, depending on the operatorís pricing strategy, cangenerate pure margins (all revenue and no cost). Of course, operators may choose to incur transaction costs for particular payment typesto encourage customers to use them. For example, customer or merchant loyalty benefits may be required to create a compelling valueproposition for merchant payments.Outgoing transactionsOutflows of value from the mobile money system include off-net P2P transfers, bill payments, airtime purchases, mobile wallet-to-banktransfers, cross-net transfers, and cash-out. These transactions cause value to exit the system, either when it is converted to cash, used tomake a purchase, or transferred to a different system (e.g., the banking system or an alternative mobile money platform).However, value leaving the system is not necessarily bad for profitability. A bill payment, for example, can generate positive marginsfor the mobile money provider and even a cash-out can yield positive margins. As the costliest transaction for operators, cash-outs areusually priced to cover agent commissions for both cash-in and out. Airtime purchases are unique transactions, however, which neitherincur costs nor generate revenue under the set of assumptions used in this analysis (see Box 2);Contactless Payment;GSMA - Mobile Money for the Unbanked

511;To date, many digital payment solutions havestarted out with propositions that integratemobile search, offers, rewards and couponswith digital payments mechanisms.The logic is that these offerings willincentivize consumers to use mobilepayments. However, digital paymentmechanisms need to be targeted at masspayment transactions to achieve massadoption firstñ and the fact is that of themany billions of payments made eachyear in a developed economy, only a smallproportion, perhaps less than 5%, involvesome form of discount, offer or loyaltyredemption. This is both because retailersímargins and business models can sustainonly a limited percentage of discountedsales, and because consumers donít havethe patience to seek them out on everysmall purchase.A prudent way to seek mass adoption isto follow relevant developments in themarketplace. Figure 7 shows possible massadoption paths based on current trends. Forexample, it is clear that digital paymentsin retailer apps can achieve mass adoption,so in-app commerce and retailer-drivenpropositions are attractive starting points.Additionally, it is clear that contactlesscard adoption is accelerating rapidly andcould achieve mass adoption in economiessuch as the UK, Poland and Turkey withina few years.

It followsthat mobile payment propositions thatbuild on the contactless card experiencehave a good chance of success.Finally, mobile banking apps are gainingrapid traction. Consumers like the userinterface offered by smartphone andtablet operating systems, and they likeusing mobile banking when they are onthe move to view balances and initiate billpayments. Adding a payment capability toa popular mobile banking app that supportspayments at PoS and over the internet maybe a surer way of achieving mass adoptionthan, say, creating a digital wallet with abase of zero customers at launch.Consumers will make the choice betweendigital wallets and mobile banking apps forpayments, and it is likely that the richerfunctionality of a digital wallet will betheir preference in the long term.

They canthen order and pay with their mobiles forlater home delivery.While innovation is continuing, retailersíinterest in payments remains purelycommercial. Whether the transfer ofvalue from the consumer takes placephysically or digitally, at the PoS, or viafixed or mobile devices, the key fromretailersí point of view is that they getthe sale, at a low transaction fee, andare paid in a secure, efficient and timelymanner, with easy reconciliation anduseful MI. The consumer experience withthe payment should not detract from thepurchasing experience, and ideally shouldenhance it and be integral to it. So atroot, they are seeking payment optionsthat enable higher footfall or clicks, lowerabandonment rates at checkout, moresales at lower cost (including lower fraudand chargebacks), and higher numbers ofrepeat and loyal customers.To help them achieve these goals, retailersare keen to move away from their currentheavy reliance on card networks. However,they want to do this without bringingin new intermediaries, without givingthird-parties access to their customersídata, and without having to make heavyinvestments in new infrastructure ñespecially not new multiple PoS devices.They also require payment systems that allcustomers can use. Their dilemma is thatthe card networks do bring this ubiquity,which very few new payment propositionscan match.To accept cards, merchants sign up toa merchant acquirer, usually a bankor a multi-bank processor. This is atraditional model, but it is also one thatfrustrates merchants, with its high fees,legacy technology and inflexibility. Ifbanks are to retain this model in thedigital world, then getting the merchantproposition right will be critical ñ notonly in offering alternatives to cards, butalso in settlement (same day is becomingimportant), reporting, data, channelcapabilities, dynamic pricing etc;Contactless Payment;Accenture - Digital PaymentsTransformation
513;a smart approachfor banks to drive mass-adoption ofdigital payments among consumers is toexpose the APIs in their own paymentsofferings for retailers and third-partydevelopers to build into their customerapps and transactions. The growing trendtowards exposing APIs is driving digitalprocesses and connectivity across allindustries, as reflected by Accentureíscreation of a strategic relationship withworld-leading API specialist Apigee (seeinformation panel). For banks specifically,exposing their payments APIs will enableretailers and other players to integratethe payments function and other bankingservices such as selection of the paymentaccount, or a request for credit to theirown requirements as they innovate aroundthe customer purchasing experience.This opens up many opportunities. Forexample, when a consumer downloads aretailer app, instead of registering theirdebit or credit card with it, they cansimply register their bank account, or evenjust their phone number (which their bankcan then decode into an account). Then,when the customer uses the retailer appto make a purchase, the bankís API allowsa payment to be made direct from theconsumerís account to the retailer.With a registered card, the retailer appcan only initiate a payment. In contrast,an embedded bank API means the retailerapp can offer a much richer series offunctions ñ such as instant refunds, credit,receipt storage for expense management,and bank-hosted loyalty programs. Figure8 shows a list of possible APIs and theircapabilities versus an embedded card.In this way, banks can meet retailersídemand for payment mechanisms relevantto their digital offering. Such a solutionallows retailers and others to proliferatebanksí payment APIs across the digitalecosystems, and enables consumers touse their bank accounts directly andsafely to pay in digital interactions.PayPal has made its APIs available forseveral years through its PayPal Developerservice6, while a banking example is CreditAgricole7 which has launched an app storeservice allowing developers to co-createapps using the bankís APIs.;Contactless Payment;Accenture - Digital PaymentsTransformation
514;While mobile wallet propositions haverecently been a major focus of mobileand digital innovation, it is unclear whatit will take to become a winning walletproposition. A key challenge is addressingthe ìall consumers, all merchantsîubiquity principle.Another challenge is using the cardsnetworks. Cards evolved over severaldecades when the technology andconnectivity options between consumersand merchants were very limitedcompared to today. Shoehorning cardsever deeper into digital ecosystemsthrough tokenization and cloud solutionscan only go so far. A wallet solutionwhich has access to hundreds of millionsof registered cards may sound like afortress solution for digital payments, butñ alongside the fact that the informationhas to be refreshed over a three to fouryearcycle as cards expire ñ it represents ahuge potential liability from a security andcompliance perspective.Therefore, while it is logical to startdigital payments propositions buildingdigital wallets using cards as a provenmass-adopted payment method, banksshould also aim to enable their coreconsumer accounts to be useable in digitalpurchase interactions by enabling bankaccounts, as well as cards, to operateon digital channels. There are successfulexamples of this approach already, suchas the iDeal payments system in theNetherlands, under which consumers payfor ecommerce purchases directly fromtheir bank account without sharing anyfinancial details with the merchant.The mobile handset or tablet has afundamental role in these account-drivenpayments. It can be used as a ìremotecontrolî device for a bank account,useable in any online, mobile or PoSpurchase to make the payment. This is avery different customer proposition froma digital wallet, which consumers canperceive to be a digital equivalent of aleather wallet, namely a ìcontainerî ofdigital cards.;Contactless Payment;Accenture - Digital PaymentsTransformation
515;Advances in technology have created thedigital payment opportunity, and banksmust continue to monitor emergingtechnologies to help evolve and enhancetheir payment offerings. A clear exampleis the growing ability of the smartphoneand tablet to act as a remote control foractivities ranging from ordering taxisto turning on the central heating orrecording TV programs at home. This makescontrolling payments from a bank accounta logical next step. To control payments,digital propositions must use security,privacy, authentication and verificationtechnologies deployed in a robust, but nonintrusiveway. Analytics, for example, can help to bringa digital payments ecosystem to life byproviding the data-driven insights andintelligence needed to respond in a relevantand appropriate way to consumersíneeds, location, personal preferencesand lifestyles. Rather than users beingbombarded with coupons, analytics meansthey can be targeted only with those theyare actively interested in and likely to use.Similarly, social media ñ again blendedwith analytics ñ provides a whole newenvironment in which banks can embedtheir payment APIs and become part ofwider interactions.;Contactless Payment;Accenture - Digital PaymentsTransformation
516;"Not only do mobile payment systems work in a variety of ways; they can also be used in a widevariety of transaction scenarios. Forrester segments mobile payment transactions into four maincategories (see Figure 1):_ Remote payments or mobile commerce. Forrester defines remote mobile payments as thepurchase of goods or services on a mobile device where the consumer is not physically present withthe merchant, the product is not acquired or consumed immediately in person, or the service is notimmediately rendered in person (e.g., eCommerce on a mobile device, also called mCommerce)._ In-person payments. We define in-person mobile payments as a purchase initiated using amobile handset at the retail POS or where the buyer and seller are present in person ó in bothattended and unattended venues. The product or service is to be rendered in person and isintended for immediate receipt or consumption._ Person-to-person (P2P) payments. Also called peer-to-peer payments or mobile remittances,P2P mobile payments are defined as domestic or cross-border person-to-person funds transfersinitiated using a mobile device._ Bill payments. The consumer uses a mobile phone to pay a bill. Bill payment can occur over themobile network or via proximity technology";Contactless Payment;Forrester - Disrupting Finance: Mobile Payment Systems
517;"This question is deceptively difficult to answer. Globally, there are hundreds of players offering awide variety of mobile payment systems for different scenarios, markets, and countries. Some ofthe most prominent mobile payment systems like Apple Pay, Google Wallet, and PayPal are partof broader digital wallet offerings that bundle various value-added services around the paymenttransaction.7 Since all of the prominent digital wallets incorporate one or more mobile paymentsystems, most digital wallets are also mobile payment systems, but not vice versa (see Figure 2). Thevalue-added services included in these wallets have driven much of the consumer adoption, anddisruptive potential, of mobile payment systems to date. We have assessed the disruptive potential ofdigital wallets specifically in a separate report.8Numerous startups and other new entrants have seized the opportunities presented by thedevelopment of mobile technologies to introduce new mobile payment systems (see Figure 3). Auseful way to understand the disruptive potential of mobile payment systems is to contrast the newentrants with the established players in the payments ecosystem. These players are: Tech titans. Alibaba, Amazon, Apple, eBay (and its subsidiary PayPal), and Google have eachgrown from disruptive startups to behemoth global tech companies. Their trusted names,immense resources, giant consumer bases, online commerce platforms, and technologicalexpertise make them well placed to succeed with mobile payment offerings. Each has playedits hand at mobile payments with its offerings: Apple Pay, Amazon Login And Pay (primarilya merchant mobile payment acceptance platform), PayPal, and Google Wallet. Google alsorecently announced it will soon be launching Android Pay._ Tech startups. Many payments disruptors began by addressing friction points in payments inspecific industries or scenarios by leveraging the latest technological innovations. There aredozens of mobile payment startups in this category. Prominent examples include Dwolla, LevelUp,LoopPay, Popmoney, and Venmo in the US; Mobino in Switzerland; and Zapp in the UK._ Telecommunication companies and mobile network operators. Since all mobile paymentactivity is happening on the devices theyíve provided to their customers, many telcos andmobile operators are seeking to capitalize on their established customer relationships. One ofthe most successful mobile payment systems is NTT DoCoMoís Osaifu-Keitai. Many mobileoperators like Sprint and U.S. Cellular have established partnerships with startup operatorbilling systems like Boku, Text2Pay, or Bango to offer mobile payment functionality forcustomers that is bundled into their normal billing cycle._ Joint ventures and consortia. Given that scale and network effects are a challenge for everycompany deploying a mobile payment system, many groups of merchants, banks, and telcoshave partnered to achieve scale. For example in the US, Softcard (formerly Isis) was developedby AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon. In Germany, O2, Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom joinedforces to launch MPass. In New Zealand, mobile operators have come together to launchSemble. Sweden has a bank-backed consortium, Swish, and an operator-backed one, WyWallet.Merchant Customer Exchange (MCX), a cross-industry consortium of approximately 50 leadingmerchants in the US, plans to launch a digital wallet called CurrenC";Contactless Payment;Forrester - Disrupting Finance: Mobile Payment Systems
518;In response to both the needs of their existing customers and the threat of disruption by new entrants,many firms in the traditional payments ecosystem have also developed mobile payment systems:_ Card networks. Card networks have massive influence in the markets where card paymentsare prominent. They are eager to avoid disintermediation by payment disrupters and shift cashpayments to cards or other electronic methods of payment. All of the major card networkshave developed one or more mobile payment system, though their systems have differentcapabilities. Visa has revamped and rebranded its V.me wallet into Visa Checkout, MasterCardhas MasterPass, and American Express offers Serve. Merchants. Merchant mobile payment offerings, such as those offered by Macyís and Starbucks,are typically integrated into their mobile commerce applications and often include offers,mobile gifting, and merchant loyalty program integration. Merchants with their own mobilepayment application have the advantage of only needing to drive adoption with their customers,which is a smaller population needed to achieve scale. Other benefits of a merchant mobilepayment system include greater customization to the merchantís specific business needs, controlover the brand and customer data, deeper customer insights, and the opportunity for lowercostpayment options such as reloadable stored-value cards. Crucially, though, these merchantmobile payment systems are usually single-merchant systems, limited to payments between themerchant and its customers, which limits their potential for disruption._ Banks and credit unions. As mobile banking becomes the most frequent customer touchpointfor many banks and credit unions, mobile payments have become a natural extension of mobilebanking functionality and a possible profit driver. With thinning margins on both creditcards and debit cards in most countries, banks are looking for additional streams of revenue.10Numerous large banks globally, including Barclays, Chase, Citi, Commonwealth Bank ofAustralia, Danske Bank, la Caixa, Royal Bank of Canada, U.S. Bank, Westpac, and many others,are developing mobile payment capabilities for their customers. The US also has a collaborativecredit union project, CU Wallet, with about 75 credit unions participating;Contactless Payment;Forrester - Disrupting Finance: Mobile Payment Systems
519;"Bearing those differences between economies in mind, mobile payment systems promise to:_ Simplify mobile commerce. Remote mobile payments evolved as consumers shifted onlineshopping behavior over to smartphones. Systems like PayPal and now Visa Checkout enablesimplified access to payment credentials on mobile devices. This facilitated mobile shoppingbecause consumers: 1) arenít forced to fumble with their credit or debit cards and manually typein their information every time they complete a mobile purchase; 2) only need to remember onelogin and password to authorize payment across various merchants; and 3) donít need to submittheir personal payment information to merchants, just to one mobile payment enabler, thuskeeping more control over their personal data._ Replace physical payment cards. Tech companies (and some merchants) see the opportunityto use mobile technology to replace plastic cards with mobile payments. That could speed upcheckout for consumers and merchants and remove friction. This is especially true in scenarioswhere speed matters to consumers in a hurry or for merchants that want to serve morecustomers, such as quick-service restaurants and casual dining. Some of the more disruptiveentrants hope to lower the costs of payments by bypassing the card networks entirely._ Replace cash. There is a massive opportunity for cash displacement in cash-based economiesaround the globe. After the success of M-Pesa in Kenya, other similar mobile payments systemsemerged, such as Telesomís Zaad in Somaliland and BRAC Bank and Money in Motionís jointventure bKash in Bangladesh. The card networks, which have historically profited from thedecline of cash and subsequent replacement by credit and debit cards, are especially keen tomake sure they arenít disintermediated by other mobile payment players.13_ Make every transaction more valuable for consumers and merchants. Many mobile paymentsystems are linking value-added services or loyalty rewards programs to payment, becomingmobile digital wallets. For merchants, mobile payments can generate valuable data. Based on datainsights like location and purchase history, mobile payment solutions can offer traditional revenueopportunities such as cross- and upselling products to existing customers, and they can also offernew revenue streams like delivering merchant-funded rewards through mobile digital wallets.";Contactless Payment;Forrester - Disrupting Finance: Mobile Payment Systems
520;In dollar terms, mobile payments still account for a tiny piece of the retail payments pie.14 Theparadox of mobile payment systems is that while in theory, mobile payment systems can be usedfor almost any transaction, in practice, there are few transactions for which customers can only usea mobile payment system.15 Driving consumer and merchant interest in and adoption of mobilepayment systems has been a steep uphill climb in developed markets because the current paymentsystems work quite well in most scenarios. Significant hurdles remain, so mobile payment adoptionwill take decades.Many mobile payments players report the year-over-year percentage increases they see in any givenmetric but are often tight-lipped about the exact numbers ó which usually indicates the numbersare small.16 The most successful mobile payment systems so far are those that are integrated intomobile digital wallets: Alipay Wallet and PayPal. Overall, leading mobile payments systems have:_ Accumulated millions of users. Few mobile payment systems report large numbers of registeredusers, with two exceptions. PayPal has 162 million active digital wallets globally.17 In China,Alipay Wallet has 190 million active users ó more than PayPal and nearly double the numberit had a year earlier.18 While Google hasnít divulged the number of Google Wallets users, roughestimates have it at 16 million active users.19 However, much of this activity is in Googleís ownGoogle Play marketplace. By comparison, Visa Checkout has 3 million registered users.20 LevelUphas 1.5 million total users, only 100,000 of whom are active.21 Meanwhile in Denmark, DanskeBankís MobilePay has1.8 million users in a country with a population of just 5.6 million people.22_ Seen an increased volume of transactions. PayPalís mobile payment volume jumped from $27billion in 2013 to $46 billion in 2014, an increase of 68% year-over-year. Mobile payments makeup about 20% of the total payments volume that PayPal receives. Venmo, owned by PayPal, isgrowing quickly, too, reaching $2.4 billion in mobile payment volume in 2014.23 In 2013, AlipayWallet boasted 18 million mobile transactions per day.24_ Raised venture capital. Many prominent mobile payment systems are either joint venturesor owned by large parent companies. However, independent mobile payment solutions haveattracted the attention of venture capitalists. Obopay, after six rounds of funding, has receivednearly $145 million in venture capital. Boku has received $73 million after five rounds. LevelUphas received $40 million in venture capital in four rounds of funding. Dwolla recently secured$9.7 million in series D funding, bringing its total funding to $32.5 million.25_ Enlisted a number of merchant or bank partners. PayPal has become a top-three onlinepayment method in a number of markets across the globe, developing a vast merchantacceptance network.26 Visa Checkout has 240 financial institution partners across the US,Canada, and Australia and 110 online merchants onboard to accept Visa Checkout payments.27One hundred and seven banks and credit unions fully support Apple Pay so far, although Apple reports 750 banks and credit unions have signed on to accept Apple Pay.28 Apple says it will beaccepted at 220,000 merchants in the US.29 MasterCard touts 40,000 merchant partners for itsMasterPass solution;Contactless Payment;Forrester - Disrupting Finance: Mobile Payment Systems
521;"As with other potentially disruptive new entrants, whether todayís mobile payment systems, orlater entrants that improve on these models, become a serious disruptive threat depends onhow established firms respond and how well each mobile payment system tackles the followingchallenges (see Figure 4):For eBusiness & Channel Strategy ProfessionalsDisrupting Finance: Mobile Payment Systems 14_ Simplicity. Many mobile payment systems do a surprisingly poor job of explaining how theywork to prospective customers. If a mobile payment system simply stores credit or debit carddetails and requires the customer to open an app, scan or ìwaveî their device, and then enter aPIN to complete the transaction, then it is no better than plastic.34 At best, paying with a mobilephone is not notably more convenient than paying with a plastic card in most scenarios; at worstit can be awkward and cumbersome._ Ability to address unmet needs. In developed economies, existing payment systems like cashand cards work fine for many transactions, so neither consumers nor merchants desperately needmobile payment systems. However, there are many important exceptions where cash, cards, orchecks are slow, awkward, or inconvenient, such as remote person-to-person payments, paymentsto small traders, and mobile commerce payments. These scenarios have given many new paymentsystems like PayPal their first foothold and are where mobile payment systems thrive._ New value creation. By themselves, mobile payment systems donít create much new value foreither consumers or merchants. Mobile contactless payments are marginally faster than contactbasedpayments and much faster than fumbling for cash, which has some value for merchantslike supermarkets. But mobile payment systems mostly substitute for existing payment systemsrather than creating new value ó unlike digital wallets._ Business model. Mobile payment systems face the challenging economics of retail payments.Payments are a business of huge volumes and thin margins. Consumers typically arenít preparedto pay for domestic payments, while merchants wonít accept systems with fees that are higherthan credit-card interchange rates.35 With small transaction volumes until they gain scale, newpayment systems have little revenue to offset the costs of new infrastructure. Satisfying everyplayer in the value chain is difficult, condemning many promising systems to failure. Thischallenging business model explains why so many startup mobile payment systems have failedor become technology vendors and why big firms like Apple and Google have developed mobiledigital wallet propositions in search of other revenue sources._ Survival. Building a new payment system and then persuading consumers and merchants toadopt it is a complex and costly undertaking. It often takes at least twice as long, and costs twiceas much, as its backers anticipate. Numerous mobile payment systems have already failed orfaded into obscurity, and more will follow suit. Only those systems with enough resources andpatience to spark network effects and create a virtuous cycle of growing consumer and merchantadoption will survive long enough to reach profitability.The lack of new value created by standalone mobile payment systems, as well as the challengingeconomics, explains why firms like Alibaba, Apple, Google, and PayPal have developed their mobilepayment systems into more capable digital wallets that offer consumers and merchants far morevalue and hence pose a far greater disruptive threat than standalone mobile payment systems";Contactless Payment;Forrester - Disrupting Finance: Mobile Payment Systems
522;"Despite the hype, mobile payment remains in the early days of development. In recent years, merchant-branded apps from the likes of Starbucks, and mobile-specific apps, like Uber and Airbnb, have continued to push the burgeoning mobile payment industry into new territories and introduce consumers to mobile payments for the first time. In the last year, the industry has seen the arrival of mobile payment platforms with a potential global reach, including the likes of Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Android Pay. In particular, Apple Pay, which Apple introduced to market in October 2014, significantly raised public awareness of mobile payments, to the extent that many outside the payments industry may have mistaken the tech titan as being the inventor of mobile payments rather than just another participant._More so than any other year, mobile payments truly started to take on a life of their own in 2014. As companies make even greater investments in mobile, the momentum is likely to continue for the foreseeable future. There are five themes that will dominate the mobile payments storyline in 2015 and are likely to shape development in the coming years: the emergence of full financial mobility, the disappearing act of payments; how couch commerce is spurring mobile payments; how payment players are making the case for proximity mobile payments and, lastly, whether traditional payment players should consider payment entrants as friends or foes.";Contactless Payment;Passport - MOBILE PAYMENTS 2015: THE FIVE MOSTIMPORTANT TRENDS SHAPING THE INDUSTRYTODAY

Startup LoopPay developed the latter, which has been embedded as a copper ring inside the new Samsung Galaxy S6 smartphones, according to Computerworld.Samsung Pay is expected to be available in the United States and South Korea this summer. The system's support for NFC and MST means Galaxy S6 users will be able to make purchases at many more retail locations than Apple Pay users, because Apple Pay requires NFC-enabled terminals.""Samsung Pay certainly heats up the competition,"" Avivah Litan, Gartner analyst, told Computerworld.

The Square Wallet mobile app, introduced in 2011, didn't catch on with consumers, however, so the company pulled it and replaced it in 2014 with Square Order, an app that lets people preorder drinks and food from local vendors. Then in March 2015, Square shut down that app, too. The company currently focuses on its Square Cash peer-to-peer mobile payments app for consumers and businesses, as well as its various PoS systems for merchants, including the Square Register app.;Contactless Payment;http://www.cio.com/article/2912896/mobile/the-state-of-mobile-payments-in-2015.html#slide13

539;Microsoft bringing mobile payment to Windows 10by Alex Rolfe | No comments | 281 ViewsWith all tech majors like Google, Apple and Samsung already offering mobile payment services, Microsoft has announced that is also planning to join the action. The payment system allows users to store credit cards, debit cards, loyalty cards, gift cards and other similar things.ìWindows is going to have a wallet concept. Youíve seen it on phones before. Weíre going to continue to iterate it. Weíre going to think about the range of payment scenarios,î Joe Belfiore, vice president and manager for the Windows Phone programme management at Microsoft, told Verge.However, Belfoire, who was speaking at the Lenovo Yoga launch event on 19 October, did not reveal any other details about the payment system, and only said it would happen ìsoon.î Citing the Windows Hello that made its debut through the latest Windows operating system version, Belfoire said it sets a good example for the ìkind of technology weíll build into devices for authentication to makeÖpayments better.îWindows Hello is a biometric authentication system which provides access to Windows 10. Your Windows 10 device can immediately recognise you through touch or by your face. Microsoft says Windows Hello is more convenient than typing a password, and more secure.Users can expect NFC technology with the updated Windows Phone payment app, something similar to what we have seen in the Wallet for Windows Phone 8. Unfortunately, this app failed to make a mark as a full-fledged mobile payment app.Microsoft appears to be quite aware of the challenges of a mobile payment service. ì[Mobile payments] is just one of these things that is a massive network of complexity. I think the biggest challenge is, What effect will cause enough of the right things to align that youíll get a good experience with all the places that you want it to happen in?

544;JPMorgan Chase to launch Chase Pay, an Apple Pay rivalby Alex Rolfe | No comments | 248 ViewsJPMorgan Chase says it will soon launch a competitor to Apple Pay, Chase Pay, that will allow consumers to pay retailers using their smartphones in stores, and it has already won the endorsement of a major group of merchants.The largest US bank is the latest company to try to profit from the prevalence ofJPMorgan Chase to launch Chase PayJPMorgan Chase to launch Chase Paysmartphones, which many financial executives believe will one day be consumersí preferred way to pay for everything from milk and eggs at the supermarket to a rental car at an airport.The companies that figure out how to convince consumers to stop pulling credit cards out of their wallets and start paying with their phones stand to earn vast sums by taking a percentage of the trillions of dollars that consumers spend annually ñ according to Reuters.No clear front-runner has emerged in the business yet. Chase believes its smart phone application, known as Chase Pay, has one key advantage: the caliber of retailers it has brought on board, Gordon Smith, chief executive of the bankís consumer business, told Reuters.Chase has signed a deal with the Merchant Customer Exchange, a group of major retailers including Wal-Mart and Best Buy to accept payments through the bankís technology.Retailers included in the Merchant Customer Exchange ring up more than $1 trillion of sales per year and have over 100,000 outlets.Rivals like Apply Pay have struggled to sign up retailers to accept their payments. In June, Reuters interviewed the top 100 US retailers and found that two-thirds said they did not plan to accept Apple Pay this year.Appleís Apple Payís website lists Best Buy in its ìComing Soonî section but has no mention of Wal-Mart.Chase signed up the Merchant Customer Exchange mainly by promising to cut retailersí costs, Smith said. Whenever a consumer pays for something with plastic, the retailer pays fees to banks and credit card networks to process the transaction.Chase is willing to accept a lower fee for Chase Pay transactions than for other transactions, and hopes to make up the difference by getting more volume over its network, Smith said.ìAs merchants give us more business, we will give them better pricing,î Smith said in an interview. Chase declined to comment on how much it would cut fees. Chase expects to market its product heavily in the middle of next year.David Robertson, publisher of the Nilson Report, which tracks the card business, said JPMorganís bid matters to players throughout the industry because of how many cardholder and merchant customers the bank has. ìThe whole thing is about scale, and Chase is a titan,î Robertson said.Chase Pay is also promising superior security, a critical selling point after retailers including Target and Home Depot suffered from hacking attacks, Smith said. Longer term, Chase also hopes merchants will offer more discounts through Chase Pay, encouraging consumers to use the technology more.Chase Pay will initially work for consumers that already have Chase credit, debit, and prepaid cards, Smith told Reuters in an interview. There are about 94 million of those cards outstanding now in the United States, and the bank has more spending on them than any other issuer. The app will work on Apple and Android-based phones.JPMorgan Chaseís consumer bank has already factored the systemís near-term launch costs into its expense estimates, and expects the benefits to come over the medium to long term.The bank will continue working with Apple Pay and other services even as it builds a rival, Smith said.;Contactless Payment;http://www.mobilepaymentsworld.com/jpmorgan-chase-to-launch-chase-pay-an-apple-pay-rival/

Existing customers have until 1 February 2016 to find another payments processor.This is not the first payment service to be axed by Amazon in recent times.

549;Samsung Pay celebrate mobile payment overachievementby Alex Rolfe | No comments | 411 ViewsAhead of its much anticipated launch in the US next week, and pitting itself in direct competition with Apple Pay, Samsung released news that its mobile payment service has processed more than $30 million worth of transactions in its first month in South Korea, a level of market adoption that the company said was ìbeyond our expectations.îThe service, Samsung Pay, competes directly with Apple Pay and Google wallet and a group of major US retailersí CurrentC. Unlike those rivals, however, Samsungís technology is designed to work even with credit card readers that havenít yet adopted next-generation NFC technology.That is to say, Samsung Pay can, in theory, work in far more situations than Apple Pay or any of its rivals ñ especially since American retailers have been slow to adopt NFC as the EMV reterminalization continues at a snails pace.A comparison of Samsung pay vs apple pay vs google walletSamsung said in its statement that it has processed more than 1.5 million total transactions so far, with about 10% of consumers who have used Samsung Pay using it every day.For Samsung, the new payment service reflects continued efforts to break through with more software and services that can set its devices apart in an increasingly crowded high-end handset market. Itís also a key test of the companyís ability to successfully integrate a startup into its sprawling bureaucracy.

550;Samsung sets target for mobile payment uptake, reveals more launch detailsSuccess for Samsung Pay will mean a penetration rate among available users of between 15 to 20 per cent, according to one of the vendorís senior executives.ìWhat is the criterion that we can say we have a very successful mobile payment service?,î asked Injong Rhee (pictured), Samsungís EVP of its B2B & Payment Group during an investor forum.He stated the vendor is aiming for a penetration of between 15 to 20 per cent of those users who have phones capable of accessing Samsung Pay.The executive emphasised its metric is number of users, not transaction volumes, in determining success.Earlier, he referenced a report that only nine per cent of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus users had tried Apple Pay, the leading rival to Samsung Pay.On that basis, the Samsung target appears bullish, although the Korean firm claims it can hit a wider demographic because its system supports both NFC-enabled terminals, as well as older, magnetic-stripe card technology.The Samsung executive also spelled out more about the rollout of the payment service. Samsung Pay will first launch in the US and Korea ìin the September timeframeî, he said, to coincide with the launch of its next flagship device.Previously, Samsung Pay availability in the two markets was pencilled in for the second half of 2015.The US and Korea will be followed by China, Europe, Australia and markets in South America, he said.;Contactless Payment;http://www.mobileworldlive.com/samsung-sets-m-pay-targets-opens-rollout

552;Adyen Mobile Payments Index reveals 36% of global mobile payments are now on iPhone Amsterdam & San Francisco 08-07-2015 Adyen, the global payments technology company, today published its quarterly Mobile Payments Index (MPI), which tracks mobile payment data from web-based transactions across Adyenís customer base.ïThe Index reveals that iPhone devices account for a massive 35.6% of all browser-based transactions made using mobile devices, and are now used for 10.2% of all global online transactions, up from 8.6% at the turn of the year.ïConversely, having once dominated the mobile payment scene with almost 50% market share in March 2013, iPad transactions now account for just 28.5% of all browser-based mobile transactions. ïBrowser-based payments on Android smartphones have been growing roughly in parallel with the iPhone since September 2014.  ïMobileís total share of online payments is up from 27.2% in Q1 2015 to 28.7% in Q2.Smartphones now undisputed king of mobile transactions The Adyen MPI shows that in terms of transaction volume, smartphones emphatically rule, increasing their lead from 61.8% of all mobile transactions in Q1 to a total of 64.1% in Q2. And itís not only due to the iPhone. Android smartphones continue to grow their share of mobile transaction volume, increasing from 27.2% in the first quarter of 2015, to 28.3%. By contrast, the use of tablets over the same period has dropped from 38.2% in Q1 2015 to 35.9% as of June 2015. iOS users spend more per transaction than Android users  For the first time, this quarter the Mobile Payments Index tracked average transaction value (ATV) by device type. It found that shoppers using an iPad spend an average of Ä104 per transaction, significantly higher than the ATV for Android tablets at Ä84. ATV across smartphone operating systems echoed this trend, with iPhones having an ATV of Ä75 compared to an Android ATV of Ä68. ìThe continued rise in popularity of the iPhone for making online purchases, coupled with the higher ATV from shoppers using iOS, suggest that businesses ñ especially those that classify themselves as premium brands ñ should target this valuable demographic in particular,î said Roelant Prins, Chief Commercial Officer, Adyen. ìApple Pay, as it becomes available in more markets, represents a great opportunity for businesses to fulfil this as it enables them to deliver a seamless payment experience to iOS users.î Tablets win retail, smartphones rule for digital Against the backdrop of the steady rise of smartphone transaction volume, when it comes to physical goods (including items such as clothing, furniture, appliances and groceries) mobile shoppers still prefer to buy on tablets. In fact, 19% of online transactions for physical goods are on a tablet, compared to 12% on a smartphone. However, for digital goods (including games, services like club memberships, hotel reservations, and tickets), the opposite is true, with smartphones accounting for 26% of online payments, up from 21% at the beginning of the year. By contrast, only 8% of digital goods were bought on a tablet this quarter. Europe continues rapid adoption In terms of regions, Europe led the way in Q2 (30.4%), followed by North America (26.7%) and Asia (21.4%). All these regions increased their share of mobile payments by approximately one percentage point from last quarter. In terms of individual markets, the UK continues to leave the rest of the world in its wake. In Q2 2015, 44.8% of online payments in the UK were made using a mobile device, up almost 2 percentage points from the beginning of the year. If the current trend persists, the UK may surpass the 50% mark for mobile transactions midway through 2016. ìThe big news dominating payments in the UK this quarter is the launch of Apple Pay. Our findings show that with the sky-high popularity of mobile payments and high penetration of iPhones in the market, in the UK Apple Pay offers a unique opportunity for businesses to connect with an affluent shopper demographic that is already used to making purchases by mobile,î Myles Dawson, UK Country Manager, Adyen.;Contactless Payment;https://www.adyen.com/home/about-adyen/press-releases/mobile-payments-index-july-2015

554;Samsung Introduces New Phones and Mobile Payments SystemHeavy lies the crown for any leader in the smartphone market, and Samsungís plan to stay in the lead is to introduce new phones alongside a new mobile payments system.The South Korean manufacturer introduced two big-screen Galaxy phones on Thursday: the Note 5, which includes a digital pen, and the S6 Edge Plus, which has a curved screen that wraps around the sides of the phone and skips the pen. The Note 5 is slightly thinner than its predecessor, the Note 4, and has some software twists. For one, you can jot down notes with the pen even when the screen is off. You can also scribble notes on digital documents before sending them. The S6 Edge Plus can be customized so that the curved edges can quickly show your favorite apps or contacts by swiping from the sides.Both phones have 5.7-inch screens and support wireless power charging. While the phones are now available for ordering online, pricing and official release dates have yet to be announced.The new devices follow Samsungís April release of the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge, which will soon get price cuts after the company reported earlier this month that its profit had declined for the seventh quarter in a row. Analysts say that the introduction by Apple last year of big-screen phones, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, as well as competition from Chinese handset makers like Xiaomi, are chipping into Samsungís profit.Samsung on Thursday also introduced its mobile wallet system, a rival to the Apple Pay system and Android Pay from Google. The new wallet, Samsung Pay, is similar to Apple and Googleís offerings, and will work with a handful of previously released Samsung devices.Samsung Pay has a few advantages over competitors. The wallet uses a technology called magnetic secure transmission, or MST, to transmit a userís credit card information to merchants at the register. It should work with many, if not most, existing credit card terminals by waving the phone over the card reader. Apple Pay uses Near Field Communication technology, which is slowly being adopted by retailers but is far from being widely accepted. But Samsung Pay also requires a few extra steps compared with Apple Pay. And in the end, Samsung, Apple and others face challenges persuading consumers to change their behavior by using the mobile payments systems instead of their regular plastic credit cards. To win over consumers, Samsung is promoting the security features of Samsung Pay. It uses a technology developed by credit card companies called tokenization, which does not require transmitting a personís credit card numbers when paying for things. (Both Android Pay and Apple Pay use this technology as well.) The company is also promoting its integration with retailer loyalty programs that Apple and Google plan to offer in their payments systems, too. Samsung unveiled the new phones and Samsung Pay ahead of the lucrative holiday shopping season ó and, perhaps more important, before Apple is expected to release new iPhones. Apple has traditionally introduced new smartphones in September.;Contactless Payment;http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/13/samsung-unveils-new-phones-and-mobile-payments-system/?partner=rss&emc=rss&_r=0

557;Google Launches Android Pay to Compete with Apple Pay and Boost Mobile PaymentsIn February, Bitcoin Magazine reported Googleís preliminary announcement of Android Pay. In June, we reported the official announcement of Android Pay at the annual Google I/O event on May 28 and 29, where Google revealed more information on its upcoming payment platform.On Thursday, September 10, Google announced that it is beginning to roll outAndroid Pay.ìWeíll be rolling out gradually over the next few days, and this is just the beginning,î notes the announcement. ìWe will continue to add even more features, banks and store locations in the coming months, making it even easier to pay with your Android phone.îAndroid Pay works with all NFC-enabled Android devices (running KitKat 4.4+), on any mobile carrier, at every tap and pay-ready location across the U.S. Android Pay will support credit and debit cards from the four major payment networks: American Express, Discover, MasterCard and Visa, issued by the most popular banks and credit unions.Existing Google Wallet users will be able to access Android Pay through an update to the Wallet app. For new users, Android Pay will be available for download on Google Play in the next few days. Currently, seven out of 10 Android phones in the U.S. are equipped for Android Pay, and the app will come pre-installed on new NFC-enabled Android phones from AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon Wireless.ìStarting Thursday, shoppers will be able to use their phone to pay at more than one million retail stores in the U.S. that have point-of-sale registers equipped with near field communication technology, known as NFC,î Fortune reports. ìAndroid Pay incorporates fingerprint biometrics to authenticate payments, whereby people verify their identity by pressing their finger onto their phoneís screens.îAndroid Pay is, evidently, Googleís response to Apple Pay. The two systems are remarkably similar, but Android Pay seems more flexible ñ as is usually the case when comparing Appleís walled garden to Androidís more open ecosystem. Android owns a much larger slice of the mobile devices market, especially in the developing world where mobile payments are growing faster. According to IDC, Android dominated the smartphone market with an 82.8 percent share in the second quarter of 2015, and itís the only mobile OS whose share is growing, while iOS, Windows Phone and Blackberry are all declining. Android Pay could, therefore, boost mobile payments.ìAndroid Pay doesnít store or transmit your credit card number,î notes The Wall Street Journal. ìInstead, like Apple Pay, it relies on an industry-standard approach called ëtokenization.í After you enter a card into Android Pay, the app generates a unique code called a token. Each card has its own token, and each token is specific to each Android. When you make a purchase with Android Pay, this token is used to create yet another temporary token to complete a purchase.îAfter launch, Android Pay will support in-store payments in more than 1 million checkout stands in the U.S. that currently work with Android Pay. Besides adding more stores, Google will enable in-app payments via Android Pay. The feature, according to the Android Pay developers website, is coming soon. ìAndroid Pay requires no changes to your payment processing,î reads Googleís invitation to developers wishing to integrate Android Pay into their apps. Apparently, Google will offer developers the possibility to channel all sorts of payments in their apps through the enhanced authentication and security features of Android pay, and leave the rest as it is.ìLeading payment gateways and processing platforms are also adding support to make it even easier for developers to enable Android Pay,ì says Google. Bitcoin-friendly companies Braintree and Stripe are among the payment processors integrating Android Pay in their platforms.It is also possible that Bitcoin wallet and payment apps developers will integrate Android Pay. According to information currently available, it appears that Bitcoin operators will be able to do so.ìWe are doing it in a way so that anybody else can build a payments service on top of Android,î Sundar Pichai ñ who was announced as the next Google CEO in August ñ said in March. That seems to imply that any external Bitcoin service will be able to integrate Android Pay. More will be known when further details of the Android Paydeveloper program are released.;Contactless Payment;https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/google-launches-android-pay-compete-apple-pay-boost-mobile-payments-1442008906
558;23B NFC chips will ship worldwide in 2020, report saysManufacturing near field communication (NFC) chips is a good business to be in right now, as contactless mobile payments and the Internet of Things become major themes in technology during the next few years.A new study out Monday from Semico Research said 23 billion NFC chips will ship worldwide in 2020.NFC chips generate a short-range radio signal for the secure transmission of sensitive financial and authentication data.NFC is known mainly for its use in contactless payments. Semico said smart cards (credit cards with chips baked in) make up more than 90 percent of the NFC market, at almost 12 billion units in 2015.The technology is increasingly used in phones for mobile payments. Itís also being used for authentication, as when the user is passing a public transportation scanner or unlocking a door to a secure facility in an enterprise. Semico said that smartphones will be using nine percent of the chips by 2020.ìThe smartphone market for NFC got a huge boost in 2014 with the introduction of the iPhone 6/6 Plus and Apple Pay,î said Adrienne Downey, Semicoís director of technology research in a statement.ìBetween that and the adoption of EMV payment standards, we should finally see adoption of NFC take off in the United States as it has already in the rest of the world,î Downey said. EMV, which stands for ìEuropay, MasterCard, and Visa,î is a protocol used by chip cards and NFC devices to exchange financial transaction data with point-of-sale terminals.Apple uses NXP NFC chips in the iPhone 6 and Apple Watch for mobile payments transactions.Semico said smartwatches and other wearable devices will be the fastest-growing host devices for NFC chips by 2020.NFC chips might also be widely used in the Internet of Things. Qualcomm recently announced that it will include NXPís NFC solution in the Snapdragon processor platform that powers mobile devices, wearables, and automobiles.;Contactless Payment;http://venturebeat.com/2015/06/01/23-billion-nfc-chips-will-ship-worldwide-in-2020-report-says/

560;Banking on disruption ñ when digital can be a force for goodJohn Davis looks at the unrelenting progress of digital services in our everyday lives, and how banks should be making the most of new opportunities.More has changed for banks in the past four years than in previous decades, and itís all thanks to the rapid pace of digital innovation. In almost every area of our lives, digital means weíre doing things differently, and this is changing our relationships with people, services and brands. Banking is no exception.As customers, we increasingly want experiences to be quick, easy and seamless. We expect to find and get what we want, when we want it. This is where disruptors are currently leading the way, delivering services that are transforming customer interactions. Take Amazon, for example, which provides exceptional customer service and moves beyond its core activities, creating more reasons for customers to become Prime members.Of course, digital disruptors are steadily encroaching on traditional banking areas. From credit cards to contactless payments, from merchant payment services to deposit accounts, all are now available from new entrants in the financial services sector. Whatís more, the innovative approach theyíre taking to these solutions is striking a chord with customers. When asked, customers have said theyíre likely to consider other such services from these providers.Rethinking banking servicesOn the other side of the coin, banks are looking to serve customers in the digital space, too. This is, after all, a more cost-effective way to manage relationships, and many customers would now rather access advice and support online than go into a branch. Yet, with banksí existing range of products and services, interactions are in danger of becoming purely transactional. The pressure is on to engage customers effectively and answer new and evolving needs with the same progressive approach being taken by their disruptive competitors.Step forward cloud-based tools. Theyíre attracting huge interest because of the rich types of data they generate, which can be turned into actionable insights. Now banks can personalize services and support to a level that was inconceivable in the days of relationship managers. For example, with these tools a small business could:ïuse bank transactions to identify customers who might have low creditïratings to help avoid bad debt and late paymentsïaccess benchmarking data to understand whether their average basket size is on a par, lower or higher than local competitorsïmatch invoicing info with bank data to predict whether an overdraft will be necessary, rather than waiting until itís too late.These tools wonít remove the need for human interaction (by phone or through live web chat for example), but they will provide many more touchpoints with customers and more reasons to engage. Such interactions can then deepen a bankís knowledge of their customers and broaden the areas where they provide support.This presents a real opportunity for banks to prove their relevance and value across a broad range of small business tasks: by learning about their customers and offering timely, relevant and complementary solutions.Building on strong foundationsIn this fast-moving world, it seems that banks have underestimated the assets they already have: strong brands that are trusted to keep personal data safe, with broad customer bases and systems that are already built to process complex data.With such strong foundations in place, perhaps the world of digital disruption can be used as a force for good, deepening engagement with customers rather than handing them to disruptors on a plate.;Contactless Payment;http://banknxt.com/51811/banking-on-disruption-when-digital-can-be-a-force-for-good/

562;"The truth about the dead of cashWill cash disappear? Many technology cheerleaders believe so, but as Rose Eveleth discovers, the truth is more complicated.Rose Eveleth 24 July 2015 Itís a hot summer day in 2025 and youíre wrapping up a long meeting at the office. Several of your colleagues have attended the meeting from home, their faces and bodies projected as holograms into seats at the table. But you came into the office, and were rewarded with a nice array of meeting snacks ñ slices of lab-grown salami and grapes. Afterwards, you step out of the office to grab some fresh air and a coffee. On the street the cars are driving themselves, and people with internet connected retinal implants walk past, checking the scores and their stocks as they go.You order a latte with soy milk ñ the only kind of milk thatís affordable any more after the collapse of the dairy industry. You reach into your wallet, and pull out a few bills, folded and slightly crumpled on the edges, smoothing them before you feed them into the robot baristaís money slot.Wait. Crumpled bills? Isnít this supposed to be the future? Nobody is going to use cash in 10 years, right?Not quite. Itís tempting to forecast the demise of cash. In fact, people have been predicting the end for physical money for nearly 60 years. With the rise of credit cards, contactless payments and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin the death knells have only gotten louder. It may seem like physical money could soon be a thing of the past, but if you take a closer look at the evidence ñ and the intriguing psychological relationship we have developed with notes and coins ñ youíll find that itís a bit premature to predict cashís disappearancePhysical money has been with us for thousands of years for a reason. Cash is essentially untraceable, itís easy to carry, itís widely accepted and itís reliable. If the power goes out, or thereís a blip in the electronic systems that make the online commerce world go round, cash is there. If someone wants to buy something without anybody tracing it back to her, cash is the way to do it. If someone wants to be certain that their form of payment will be accepted, cash is the best bet. Even with advances in technology, some of the aspects of cash simply arenít reproducible with bits just yet.""Cash is essentially untraceable, itís easy to carry, itís widely accepted and itís reliable There is simply no alternative system of payment that is as convenient, reliable and anonymous. Bitcoin is anonymous, but currently unstable and inconvenient. Credit and debit cards are widely accepted, but they instantly connect your purchases with your person. Peer-to-peer payment systems like Paypal or Venmo require apps and accounts, and are still easily traceable.Then thereís the question of global reliability. In the case of American money, cash has value beyond the borders of the country. In fact, two thirds of cash holdings in American dollars exist outside the country. People store up cash for emergencies, to keep a safety net, and to ensure that whatever happens, their wad of cash will be there for them.While technology is trying to design a system that has all the components that cash does, itís simply not there yet. Which is why, when you look at the statistics we have on cash use around the world, paper and coin isnít doing too badly after all.Number crunchingItís difficult to put a number on just how much cash is used day-to-day across the globe. One of cashís key attributes is how hard it is to track. Still, the data that does exist gives us a glimpse.""Two thirds of cash holdings in America exist outside the country The first way to estimate cash use is to calculate how much of it is in circulation. By this measure, cash is far from disappearing. In the United States, cash in circulation grew 42% between 2007 and 2012, and the amount of American money floating around in bills and coins is expected to grow by about 5% each year. The average growth globally is 7% per year, according to Eric Ziegler, President of the Security Technologies Group at Crane Currency, which manufactures notes.However, thatís not the same as how much cash is actually changing hands in daily transactions. ìNobody has a way of going into the economy and counting how many bills are out there and the value of those bills,î says Daniel Wilson, an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. ìWe donít know exactly how many cash transactions are occurring on any given day.îTo get some sense of how cash moves, economists design models and surveys. In the Netherlands, for example, economist Nicole Jonker and her team at the Dutch National Bank conducted something called a diary study, in which they asked participants to write down a dayís worth of transactions, both cash and non-cash. From there, Jonker and her team built a picture of the how Dutch people were buying things.The Netherlands is an interesting case study to look at more closely, because their retail sector has recently embraced card payments in a big way. There are now 1,400 supermarkets in the Netherlands with registers that donít accept cash.""In the UK, half the transactions by consumers in 2013 were with cash As a result, card payments in the Netherlands have been growing by about 8% annually over the past few years. And yet, cash is still king. In 2012, there were 2.7 billion card payments, but an estimated 3.5 to four billion payments were made with cash. ìEven in supermarkets which all accept debit cards, cash is still used heavily,î Jonker says. ìFor the time being we think cash will keep on having an important role.î Studies of other nations tie in with these findings. In the UK, half the transactions by consumers in 2013 were with cash, according to a report released in May by the UK Payments Council (now known as Payments UK). ìThe current forecast is that this figure will drop below 50% next year (2016), but there is no prediction for cash to disappear,î the report reads.And one study that rounded up surveys like Jonkerís from around the world found that, in the seven countries they looked at ó Australia, Austria, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands and the United States, 46-82% of all transactions in 2012 were conducted using cash (a wide range that may reflect both the uncertainty in the survey methods, and the variability between nations).Even countries that are often held up as the leaders of a cashless crusade, such as Sweden and Denmark, arenít really getting rid of notes and coins. In June of this year, there was a round of headlines declaring that Denmark would rid itself of cash by 2016. ìBurn your bills: Denmark wants to go cashless by 2016,î the headlines read. Not even close, Rene Thomsen, manager at the Danish Bankers Association told me. ìI think, thereís been some misunderstanding on what the Danish proposal really is,î he said. In Denmark, he explained, there is currently a rule that all shops must accept cash. This new proposal would let some shops get around that rule. Thatís all.ìItís difficult to say, but I would be very surprised if we didnít have cash in 10 to 15 years,î he says. ìItís hard to imagine that within 10 to 15 years that itís not possible to go into a bank and say ëI would like $1,000 and I want it in cash.íîIrrational urge  Perhaps cashís sticking power has something to do with our strange relationship with notes and coins. As with most of our decisions and preferences, our affinity for cash isnít entirely rational. People value cash differently than they value electronic money, even though the two have the exact same value. Psychologist Eric Uhlmann, from the Paris School of Management, has done a handful of studies that picked apart how differently people feel about different kinds of money. ìIím interested in human intuition and economic irrationalities,î he says. ìThereís this sort of irrational feeling that if money is physical, itís more yours, and you feel like you own it more. If you touch a dollar more, then that particular dollar becomes yours.î""Thereís this irrational feeling that if money is physical you feel like you own it more Uhlmann tested these ideas by presenting a set of scenarios to participants. In one, they were told a story about Ted and Donna. Forty years ago, the story goes, Tedís great-grandfather stole $1,000 from Donnaís great-grandfather. Ted eventually inherited that money. In one scenario, Ted inherited the actual money ñ a wad of bills in a box that his great-grandfather passed down to him. In the other scenario Tedís great-grandfather deposited that money into Tedís bank account. When Donna finds out that Ted has the money, she asks for it back.Participants were then asked whether Ted should give the money back to Donna. Those who heard the story with the physical money, in which Ted had a box of bills, were more likely to say that he should give Donna the money back. Participants who heard the story in which the money lived in Tedís bank account, rather than a box, were more likely to say that Ted no longer had ìquite the sameî money that had been stolen, and were less inclined to force Ted to hand it over.This kind of thinking applies not to just dollars in a box, but larger questions of theft and justice as well. Another researcher has done studies showing that people feel less negatively about white-collar crime, where people arenít stealing physical things, than they do about blue-collar crimes in which an object is taken. Another study found that people cheat more when theyíre cheating for tokens, than when theyíre cheating for actual money. If you leave a Coca-Cola out, people are far more likely to take it than if you leave a dollar.""Thereís been a backlash against abolishing pennies ñ despite being worth less than they cost to produce Of course there are limits to these effects. ìIf your bank subtracts money from your account, youíd still feel stolen from,î Uhlmann says. But when the two amounts are the same, there is a clear difference in how we feel about physical money compared to its digital proxy. ìIt says something really interesting about the human mind,î he says, ìand the difficulty that we have being logical despite our rational beliefs.î Could that mean that we might resist giving up cash entirely? Thereís some evidence that suggests so. In the US, there has been a backlash against abolishing pennies ñ despite being worth less than they cost to produce, some Americans arenít ready to part with the coin. Over in Australia, talk of abolishing the five cent coin was met with concern over the loss of income that charities receive from small change, and potential consumer backlash over rounded-up prices.History also suggests that there is a safety and security we feel about cash that digital currencies canít quite match. Anybody whoís seen Mary Poppins knows the chaos that can happen when thereís a run on the banks. When thereís a financial crisis, people would rather have their money in hand, than behind the tellerís window or in the cloud.Itís possible of course that developed Western countries like the US may be more attached to cash than elsewhere. ìDifferent cultures have different attachments to their currencies,î says Nicolas Christin, a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University, ìand as far as the US is concerned thereís a strong attachment.î Christin argues thatís because in the US the national currency has been relatively steady, where other countries have seen periods of boom and bust in the value of their money. This might make Americans more attached and trustworthy of their bills than other people.The mobile caveat  While most conversations about the future of technology might myopically focus on America and Europe, some of the greatest innovations in money arenít coming from either place. In some developing countries, cash transactions are quickly being replaced by digital payments, powered by mobile phones.""'Kenya has done mobile payments better than anyone' - Benjamin Mazzotta While in the US, you still might buy your coffee with cash in 2025, that might not be the case in Kenya. In 2007, Kenyans began to adopt a system called M-Pesa and today it is used by over 17 million Kenyans, over two-thirds of the adult population. Users top-up their accounts and transfer money by sending a text message; the recipient then takes their phone to a vendor to get their money. No banks are involved.ìKenya has done mobile payments better than anyone,î says Benjamin Mazzotta, a researcher at Tufts University who studies cash use. ìM-Pesa is now accepted not just for large transfers, but for meals and clothes and school tuition. You can do lots of things with M-Pesa today that five or 10 years ago would have sounded like Neverland.îStill, in places like the US and Europe, a system like M-Pesa might have a harder time catching on. Much of the technologyís success is due to the fact that itís run by Safaricon, the countryís largest mobile-network operator by far. In other countries, competition is stronger: if each operator chooses to introduce their own proprietary form of mobile payment, it might not be anywhere near as convenient and seamless.Take the Apple Pay system for example. Apple has faced hurdle after hurdle in getting the system adopted both in the United States and elsewhere. Theyíve struggled to cut deals with places like China, where one company controls transactions between banks.And itís worth remembering that M-Pesa is a system for moving cash around, not a system to eliminate it. Users still hand cash to the M-Pesa vendors to top-up their accounts, and retrieve cash from them when money is sent to them.So, while tech evangelists might like to believe they can replace global use of cash with digital transactions or Bitcoin, the truth is a bit more complicated and the hurdles arenít all fixable by technology alone. Our psychological attachment to money, the infrastructure available to banks, and the need to create systems that are compatible with lots of vendors and users, all make progress away from cash more of a slog than a sprint.Money makersWhen you ask those who actually make currency whether they lose sleep over the looming cashless future, they say theyíre not worried. ìFrankly, based on the continued growth rate of cash, we donít anticipate the disappearance of cash in the possible near term, or even medium term,î says Eric Ziegler at Crane Currency, a money design and manufacturing company. He doesnít think Crane even has a cashless contingency plan, nor that they need one.""The fight against counterfeiters goes all the way back to the 4th Century BC Of course, saying that cash isnít going away isnít the same as saying cash is going to look the same forever. Banks and printers are constantly engaged in the fight against counterfeiters ñ a fight that goes all the way back to the 4th Century BC. And our future money will probably be a lot more digital than it is now.Manufacturers like Crane are developing futuristic bills that involve large, easy to recognise security features. According to Ziegler, the best security features are the most obvious ones. ìYou want it to be technologically advanced, but so easy and obvious that if itís missing the average cashier isnít going to miss it,î he says. For that reason, he says, future money will likely continue to feature portraits and heads. Not just because we love to memorialise people, but because portraits are also a great way to challenge counterfeiters because as humans weíre good at recognising irregularities in faces. ìIf the hair is slightly different, or the glasses are off, we notice,î says Ziegler. ìPortraits are a great security feature.îBeyond creating new bills with advanced security features, others are toying with the idea of slapping the digital world right on top of the physical one. In 2001 the European Union considered adding an RFID chip to each bill, largely in response to a huge number of counterfeit euros discovered in Greece. They ultimately rejected the idea, as it would increase the cost of producing bills dramatically, but according to Christin, future money might be full of these kinds of digital elements. In fact, itís not the technology thatís missing, Christin says, itís the infrastructure.  An RFID chip is only useful if someone has an RFID reader to scan it with. ìThink about the guy on the beach in Thailand who wants to rent a surfboard,î says Christin. ìDo you have all the infrastructure you need to use that technology there?î""Unless we have sufficient and reliable alternatives in place, it would be dumb to get rid of cash now ìItís not that the technology doesnít exist,î he adds, ìit does, it would just cost a lot of money and be hard to deploy universally.î In other words, the exact challenges that face digital currencies are what make digital additions to cash so difficultSo where does that leave us? ìUntil we have sufficient and reliable alternatives in place, it would be dumb to get rid of cash now,î says David Wolman, author of the book The End of Money. ìHonest people and legit businesses still rely on it.î Instead of constant cheering or hand wringing about the word ìcashless,î people should be examining the trends that are pushing cash away. ìIt would be foolish to conflate enthusiasm about the impact of that marginalisation with unthinking cheerleading for cashís total demise,î he says.Many who think about cash like to use Mark Twainís quote: ìreports of my death have been exaggerated.î In one paper, the authors compare cash to a kind of Cinderella. ìIt doesnít have a mom or dad to watch over it ñ just those horrible stepsisters that try to convince Cinderella that she is ugly. But she isnít,î they write. Cash is with us, and it will stay with us whether Bitcoin and PayPal advocates like it or not.On that fall day in 2025 you may take a self-driving car to work, or hologram into the office, and you may not even touch a piece of paper money. But youíll likely still have a few notes and coins on hand somewhere, just in case.

563;Contactless payments hit £2.5bn mark as spending limit risesAs the contactless payment limit in the UK rises from £20 to £30, the UK Cards Association has found that more and more consumers are ditching traditional payments, with over £2 billion being spent in the first six months of the year via contactless cards.Contactless futureAs the popularity of contactless payments increases in the United Kingdom, payment terminals across the country are being adjusted to accept NFC payments of up to £30, allowing consumers greater freedom and accessibility when paying for everyday goods and services. This then raises the question ñ is the UK becoming a cashless society?The UK Cards Association, the trade body for the card payments industry in the UK, certainly thinks so.During 2015, contactless payment figures have skyrocketed. The trade body has found that spending via a contactless card has risen from £287m per month in January 2015 to £567m in June of this year.In total, £2.5 billion has been spent within the first six months of 2015 using a contactless device.This figure shows that contactless payments are really picking up, as throughout 2014 only £2.32 billion was spent using a contactless cards.contactless graphMore choice for consumersNow that the UK has caught on to the rising trend of contactless payments, more and more shops are making the method available for their customers.Graham Peacop, chief executive officer of the UK Cards Association has welcomed the limit increase.ëëContactless payments are fast, easy and secure. With more contactless cards in wallets than ever before and a growing number of retailers accepting contactless payments, we have seen a huge rise in the number of payments being made.ííëëThe growth in contactless payments shows people want to use contactless cards and increasing the limit gives customers even more opportunities to pay in this way,íí continued Peacop.The family food shop could become a lot easier with the new change. According to research from Barclaycard, Brits pay contactless most often at supermarkets, followed by restaurants and on commuter transport.With the average food shop costing £25.17, parents and commuters will now be able to shave some time off their busy schedule using a contactless card.For customers who are worried about the security risks posed by contactless payments, the trade body has assured apprehensive spenders that there is nothing to fear.Contactless cards contain the same encryption technology as Chip and Pin devices. When using your card for contactless purposes, you may sometimes be asked to type in your pin, only to ensure they are the genuine card holder.Collective decisionWith more than 69 million contactless cards in circulation, the cards payments industry took it upon themselves to raise the spending limit in order to make it easier for British consumers. Some of the worldís biggest payment institutions have embraced the payment change.ëëContactless is becoming the ënew normalí as everyday Britons embrace the speed, convenience and safety of touch-to-pay technology,íí commented Kevin Jenkins, managing director UK and Ireland at Visa Europe.ëëWeíve seen unprecedented growth in this area, with the number of Visa contactless transactions more than trebling in the past year in the UK.ííëëTodayís threshold increase to £30 gives consumers all the benefits of contactless across a broader range of their daily activities, and we expect to see this momentum continue to build as more people adopt mobile and wearable payment technology.íí;Contactless Payment;http://www.paymenteye.com/2015/09/01/contactless-payments-hit-2-5bn-mark-as-spending-limit-rises/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=contactless-payments-hit-2-5bn-mark-as-spending-limit-rises
564;Worldís first contactless payment jacket launchesLyle & Scott, the iconic British menís lifestyle brand, has today launched the worldís first contactless payment jacket in partnership with bPay by Barclaycard.The jacket, which fuses together technology, functionality, fashion and style, has contactless payment technology integrated into the cuff of the right sleeve. The technology comprises a small chip - like the one in credit and debit cards - that is inserted into the jacket, under the cuff on the right-hand sleeve. Available in admiral blue or true black, the double-faced hooded contactless jacket allows the wearer to make contactless payments with just a tap of the cuff on any contactless payment terminal for anything costing £30 and under at over 300,000 locations across the UK. Launched by Barclaycard last year, bPay is available to anyone with a UK-registered Visa or MasterCard debit or credit card, not just Barclaycard and Barclays customers. Users can conveniently add funds to their digital wallet íon the goí using a mobile app, online through a brand new portal, or set their account to top-up automatically when their balance falls below a pre-set level. The contactless jacket is one of the first products to be launched under the direction of Lyle & Scottís innovation team. The team was established to deliver ground-breaking products and services that engage and excite customers, as well as create a culture of leading edge thinking throughout the organisation. Jonathan Briggs, innovation project manager at Lyle & Scott said: íWe are a brand that embraces our heritage however we understand that it is extremely important to stay in touch with the needs of our modern customers. Innovation is key to realising this, and so we are proud to partner with bPay to launch the worldís first contactless payment jacket. The jacket can be used to pay at any contactless terminal for transactions up to £30, ultimately seizing the next step in satisfying the consumerís need for flexibility and convenience.íThe launch of the bPay jacket by Lyle & Scott comes as contactless payments have been widely adopted amongst the UK public. According to the UK Cards Association, contactless payments rose 331% year-on-year in 2014 with the public making 319 million contactless transactions with a total value of £2.32 billion using the technology. Mike Saunders, managing director of digital consumer payments at Barclaycard said: íThis collaboration with Lyle & Scott shows the potential of wearable payments and how they can be customised to fit more conveniently and easily into consumersí everyday lives. The great thing about bPay is its versatility, allowing users to turn almost anything into a contactless way to pay.íInsight from our customers has found that people want contactless payments to be seamless, fast and convenient, however the style and look of the product is also incredibly important. The combination of the heritage of a brand like Lyle & Scott, with the latest payments technology from bPay will further advance contactless payments as being the easiest and quickest way to buy everyday things - be it a morning coffee, quick trip to the supermarket, or a bus trip across town.í Safer than carrying cash and just as secure as any credit and debit card, all payments come with the same fraud protection that is applied to contactless cards. If lost or stolen, users can remotely shut down their contactless chip via the bPay mobile app or bPay website. Following the successful launch of its bPay band last year, Barclaycard recently unveiled three new wearable payment devices - a wristband, fob and sticker. An innovator in the payment industry, Barclaycard was the UKís first credit card to launch (in 1966) and was the first to roll out contactless payments, in 2007. More recently, it has trialled a wide range of contactless projects, ranging from a trial of contactless donkey rides in Blackpool to contactless gloves for shoppers during the Christmas period.;Contactless Payment;http://www.efma.com/index.php/resources/articles/detail/EN/1/509/1-1SEA14
565;Can MCX make contact as contactless wallets, cards take off?As contactless payment cards finally begin to take off in the United States, a failure by retailers to partner with leading card networks for the MCX CurrentC mobile wallet is shaping up as yet another problem for the already struggling solution.The number of mobile wallets using contactless technology is expected to reach 200 million by the end of 2016, up more than 100 percent from the end of 2014, according to a new report from Juniper Research. Contactless mobile wallets are likely to gain ground at the same time as contactless cards do in the United States as the deadline set by payments companies approaches for having the necessary terminals in place.ìThe best that could be said of [MCX] is that itís ëdrowning with no sign of a lifeguard,íî said Dr. Windsor Holden, head of forecasting and consultancy at Juniper Research.ìItís difficult to see how it will be able to gain any kind of traction given its own internecine disputes over strategy, delays in launch and the lack of a major credit card partner,î he said.A series of misstepsMCX is a consortium of big-name retailers that has been developing its own mobile payments solution.However, there are signs that it is struggling, including a delayed launch and the fact that several retailers have started accepting Apple Pay. This is a change in approach, with member retailers originally agreeing to accept MCXís CurrentC exclusively.MCX appears to have also made a mistake by choosing to focus on store brand payment cards as opposed to partnering with the card networks.As a result of these missteps, by the time MCX launches, U.S. consumers will have a choice of possibly half a dozen other mobile wallets, an increasing number of which will also have contactless payment cards.ìThe initial decision to act as a closed shop with regards to other contactless payment methods [was a mistake],î Dr. Holden said. ìConsumers donít like to be told how they can and canít shop ñ that was how the major stores lost out to the online players 10 years ago.ìSecond, not getting an agreement with one or more major payment cards and deciding that they would rely solely on own brand credit cards and loyalty cards,î he sad. ìThat consigned them to the margins at the outset.î Juniperís research found that while person-to-person services have historically driven growth of mobile wallet use, the launch of Apple Pay last year initiated a surge in activity in the contactless arena.With public awareness of contactless payments on the rise, this will benefit Samsung Pay, which recently launched, and Android Pay, which is expected to launch soon.Apple Pay 400 2Apple Pay has driven awareness of contactless paymentsThe report, Mobile Wallets: Contactless & Remote Payments 2015-2020, highlights how numerous banks are partnering with Visa and MasterCard to implement branded contactless wallets using a cloud-based secure element.Other findings include that wallets run by wireless carriers continue to fare badly, with Weve in Britain dropping plans for a wallet and Softcard folding in the U.S.In developing markets, Juniper reports there has been a significant upscaling of wallet usage for savings and loan disbursements, while more than 100 million are now in use for micro-insurance.ìThe US is rather different to most European markets, in that only with EMV will contactless cards begin to gain traction ñ in Europe, contactless cards have seeded the market,î Dr. Holden said. ìItís likely that the US will see the two develop in tandem.î;Contactless Payment;http://www.mobilecommercedaily.com/can-mcx-make-contact-as-contactless-wallets-cards-take-off

567;How to ensure secure contactless paymentsThe use of online banking and shopping has grown significantly, but so too has the number of security threats targeting such services. According to the latest  Breach Level Index report, 888 data breaches occurred during the first half of 2015 alone, compromising 246 million records worldwide. However, while cash and card payments are still the most widespread methods of payment, and though security is a key concern for many people,  studies show that UK shoppers increasingly prefer using mobile payments instead of credit cards. If this trend continues, mobile payments could very well become the new norm, especially once the ceiling limit for contactless payments increases to £30 in the UK this year.     While the need to secure payment transactions and data remains critical, and though there is heightened pressure to comply with credit card payment standards, securing financial data is far from simple. Contactless payment cards will expose sensitive information to anyone using the appropriate wireless equipment. As with all technology, this equipment is becoming ever more readily available and lower cost. So what can businesses do to ensure that their most sensitive data remains protected? The payment industry always planned that the risks associated with exposing information over wireless connections would be mitigated by stronger controls put around transactions made over the telephone or Internet. This is why itís vital for businesses to protect their customersí data as early in the transaction process as possible by moving to a framework that is centred on the data itself. This means adopting a ësecure breachí approach to data protection which focuses protecting sensitive data wherever it exists. Rather than focusing on specific points of vulnerabilities, end-to-end encryption secures data from the earliest possible moment of its capture, ensuring that data remains in an encrypted state consistently until it arrives at the payment gateway.  However, encryption alone is only part of the solution. Organisations should invest in a standards-based enterprise key management strategy that should include specific methods of limiting access to keys, defining how those keys are issued and distributed, and providing protections for them as they are stored. Without these considerations, keys could be copied, modified or even impersonated by a skilled hacker, who could then access cardholder data. Being breached is not a question of ìifî but ìwhenî. Long term securityóas well as business successówill hinge on an organisationís ability to more comprehensively and strategically manage its security efforts. Only by adopting a data-centric approach that leverages the cloud to secure sensitive information across its entire lifecycle, can companies be safe in the knowledge that their data is protected, whether or not a security breach occurs.;Contactless Payment;http://www.finextra.com/blogs/fullblog.aspx?blogid=11649&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=finextrachannels

571;JP Nicols is at Money20/20 this week, looking at ideas: what works, what doesnít, and why.This week, Iím in Las Vegas for Money20/20, the huge payments and financial services innovation conference, and as always Iíll be on the lookout not only for cool ideas and technology, but in particular those that can bring a competitive advantage for financial institutions.There will be a ton of content on EMV, mobile and contactless payment developments, POS and transaction data, authentication and security, and of course, there will be lots of blockchain. Blockchain is the new ëe-businessí ñ it will make you better, faster, stronger, smarter and better looking. Iím sure someone will try to tell me how much better my dining experience could be if the menu was on the blockchain.Donít get me wrong, I think blockchain technology holds incredible promise for many areas in financial services, and some truly brilliant people are doing amazing work. Weíre going to see some real breakthroughs for the groups that solve problems that people (and banks) care about solving.At the same time, what are we now Ö 15 years into talking about ëomni-channelí experience? And probably going on five years into the backlash that we shouldnít be thinking about channels at all (or at least not digital versus face to face). Many (if not most) financial institutions are still struggling to close the widening gap between what their customers expect and what theyíre able to deliver, as I wrote about recently.Itís not the lack of technology that holds them back, nor is it lack of great ideas, but which ideas have been on the hype curve too long, and which ones are ready for prime time? Why are some ideas viral with certain groups of people, yet unheard of in others? My colleagues and I have been spending a lot of time working on how ideas and people come together and how the most innovative organizations in the world embrace multiple approaches in discovering and implementing new ideas. (Read more: Innovation is more than the next big idea.)I continue to believe that very few banks will be product innovation leaders, so the battle for most will be to try to become truly customer intimate after spending so many years investing in scale and scope and standardization and efficiency ñ the marks of infrastructure management. (Another topic Iíve been writing about for some time now: How banks can compete in the future.) So, Iíll be looking for examples of innovative product ideas that can partner well with banksí infrastructures to create that elusive customer intimacy, and bridge that customer experience gap.This week, Iíll also be working in partnership with Capital One to take a deeper dive into how they approach innovation. The bank runs three innovation labs, and they work on both the day-to-day incremental improvements into more transformative innovation, some of which come from acquisitions they have made along the way. Iíve shared the following cool video on YouTube about their labs with my students at the Pacific Coast Banking School.One of the key acquisitions was that of the big data analytics company Bundle in 2012, which ultimately resulted in Bundle founder and CEO Jaidev Shergill becoming managing partner for Capital One Growth Ventures.On Tuesday 27 October from 3:30 to 4:30, Iím moderating a discussion with Jaidev and his colleague Lauren Connelley at the Capital One Booth at the Venetian during Money20/20. I encourage you to join us if youíre at the event, but Iíll report highlights here.Iíll be talking with Jaidev and Lauren about their approach to investing and technology companies, and how their strategic approach differs from a pure financial investor. A lot of the early stage companies Iíve worked with have struggled to gain insights directly from the banks theyíre tying to sell to and partner with, and not all of their funding sources have been able to provide much help either.;Contactless Payment;http://banknxt.com/53889/ideas/
572;"MasterCard to drive payments for the Internet of ThingsAs the market for the Internet of Things and wearables continues to take shape worldwide, MasterCard wants to be at this shift's forefront ó and is giving companies the ability to add payment credentials to devices such as automobile key fobs, smart rings and even clothing through a program that is an extension of its digital enablement service. MasterCard Monday announced at the Money20/20 conference in Las Vegas that its initial partners in this endeavor include fashion designer Adam Selman, automotive giant General Motors, wearable technology company Nymi, smart jewelry company Ringly and Bluetooth locator TrackR. ""What we're trying to do with this announcement and creating this program is to show that there are many possibilities [with the Internet of Things, wearables and payments],"" Sherri Haymond, senior vice president and group head for digital channel engagement at MasterCard, told Mobile Payments Today in an interview ahead of the announcement. ""What we're doing is trying to marry [payments] with some of the creative energy that comes with companies like Ringly, and Adam Selman,"" she said. ""We also envision yet-to-be-imagined devices that will also contain a payments functionality.""MasterCard is working with chip manufacturers NXP and Qualcomm to help companies implement contactless payments capabilities into their devices. Capital One is the first prominent issuer to announce its support for MasterCard's program.  Nymi is one of the first companies to bring its concept for wearable payments into the public, albeit in a limited pilot. The Toronto-based company over the summer announced what it called the world's first biometrically authenticated, wearable credit card payment using one's heartbeat. Nymi is working with TD Bank and MasterCard on the project. More than 100 TD users in Toronto, Ottawa and Regina during the summer tested the Nymi Band's contactless payment functionality. Other participating Canadian banks are scheduled to launch similar pilots this quarter, and Nymi expects several thousand payments to be made using the Nymi Band during this time.""MasterCard's initiative is a natural fit with Nymi's vision of seamless and secure user experiences,"" Karl Martin, founder and CTO of Nymi, said in a statement. ""The next generation of integrated experiences is about ease and delight, where security can simply be assumed.""General Motors' contactless key fob is another example of what we can expect not only for proximity ""mobile"" payments, but also what Haymond called a more ""integrated commerce experience"" that involves a consumerís automobile. Not only will consumers use the key fob to pay for a latte at Starbucks once the coffee chain installs contactless point-of-sale terminals in its stores, but the device also can interact with an automobile's console when inserted into the ignition to allow for those integrated commerce experiences Haymond mentioned.If you need to order a pizza on the go from the car, and pick it up on the way home for dinner, GM will have you covered. ""Vehicles are becoming more connected, and this will enable our customers to maximize their connections to all aspects of their lives, including new and easier ways to pay for goods and services,"" Tom Grekowicz, senior manager for GM Rewards Card, said in a statement. ""This partnership with MasterCard will help us learn more about our customers' preferences and how we can best serve them.""MasterCard emphasized the security of these transactions in this announcement and will use what it calls ""domain restrictions"" on the tokenized data in each device. ""If someone tries to use a payment credential that was provisioned for a Ringly ring for an e-commerce transaction, MasterCard's system will know that the transaction is fraud and will decline it,"" Haymond said.";Contactless Payment;http://www.atmmarketplace.com/articles/mastercard-to-drive-payments-for-the-internet-of-things/

High global awareness of Apple PayHelixion, a contactless payments research group based in Edinburgh, asked 450 Android users from the US, UK Australia, Canada and Italy about their relationship to payment technology.One of the first questions that Helixion asked was: Are you aware that Apple has launched a mobile payment product called Apple Pay?Respondents in the United States showed a high awareness (69 per cent), which is predictable as Apple Pay was launched in the country first.Over half of UK users (65 per cent) also were aware of Apple Pay, followed by Italy (58 per cent), Canada (53 per cent), but less than half of Australian users know what the payment service is.One thing that is clear however, is the need for an NFC payments system. Google has already launched Android Pay in the United States, but has yet to do so in the other four nations surveyed. Helixion asked another question to its participants: would Android users use a service like Apple Pay if it was available?A huge 78 per cent of global respondents said ëYesí, with 83 per cent of Australian consumers agreeing with the statement, but the research group is wary of whether these respondents will actually begin to use a mobile payments platform.apple pay graphëëOnly time will tell how long it will be before those 78% become actual users,íí stated Helixion.ëëOne thing is for sure, mobile payment on Android has strong potential.

It's integration with the wallet means the payment capability is directly linked to the Capital One Wallet features, including tools for managing spending, instant rewards and redemption offers, easy access to balance and transaction history, and real-time notification for all transactions.Capital One leveraged MasterCard Digital Enablement Service and Visa Token Service to deliver the service and provide security.Capital One's digital solution creates a seamless consumer experience, and delivers a compelling payment choice for their customers,"" MasterCard's chief emerging payments officer Ed McLaughlin said.Capital One introduced its mobile wallet, first on Apple's iOS and then on Android about a year ago. The app has more than 1 million users, Capital One's managing vice president of digital payments Tom Poole told Bloomberg.Both Samsung and Google introduced Android-based payment services in September. Almost all new Android phones are equipped with the NFC functionality to enable contactless payments.Although contactless pay was first launched on Apple's iPhones, with the way the iPhone is structured Apple Pay has sole access to the iPhone's NFC chip and is the only app that can facilitate NFC-based transactions on iOS, according to Venture Beat. Apple charges a fee for facilitating purchases using its technology. As a result, Capital One, or other banks, will not be able to introduce the payment functionality for iOS. Apple users can, however, add the Capital One Wallet to Apple Pay as a payment option.Having a mobile app, and enabling functionality through it, will allow Capital One to maintain a direct relationship with customers on their mobile devices. Capital One's Poole told Venture Beat that he expects other banks will offer this type of functionality to their customers soon.";Contactless Payment;http://www.fiercefinanceit.com/story/capital-one-first-us-bank-offer-contactless-payment-mobile-app/2015-10-15
577;"Virtual pickpockets steal money from contactless bank cards by bumping into victims claims LondonerThieves are stealing money from the contactless bank cards of commuters on busy trains. One victim, who works for a computer security magazine, alleges that a man standing next to him stole £20 from his card through an unauthorised contactless payment.Roi Perez, the south London-based community manager of SC Magazine, claims a man bumped into the pocket containing his wallet and took the money, which was later refunded by his bank. Such instances have prompted concerned card users to line their wallets with transaction-blocking tin foil.Telling his story on the magazine's website, Perez said: ""When a man slowly bumped into me and my pocket for a bit too long, it took me a second to realise what had just happened. I called my bank and found out that said individual had managed to steal £20 from my account via a contactless card payment; my bank promptly reimbursed me.""Contactless credit and debit cards are now issued as standard by UK banks. They can be used to make payments of up to £30 and are used by simply tapping them against a card reader; no PIN or signature is required. Although it has been previously reported that a person's details can be stolen from a contactless card and used to make payments online, this appears to be the first case of money being taken directly from the card, as it would be in a shop.'An illegal transaction took place on the train'Clarifying his story to a commenter, Perez said: ""The card was not stolen, but an illegal transaction took place in which £20 was deducted from an account via an unauthorised contactless payment which happened on the train.""Even though it seems instances of money being stolen directly from contactless cards are rare, people have taken measures to physically protect themselves. A commenter posting on the blog of security expert Graham Cluley, who wrote about Perez's incident, said: ""I shield my contactless cards with foil-lined paper wallets. I got a Transport for London inspector to check he couldn't read my Oyster card through one. I also bought a lined wallet for my passport.""A large number of wallets which claim to block RFID frequencies from reading your bank cards are available online. So-called 'bouncer cards' can also be bought and slipped into a wallet to prevent your cards from being read.The incident led Perez to investigate how such a theft could be possible. ""It got me wondering about what processes a hacker would have to go through to get hold of a 'merchant' account and start processing genuine payments. The card readers are readily available [online]...for £79.""The next step would be moving the stolen money on before the thief is caught. ""Someone could be taking money from the account the stolen money goes into, converting it into bitcoins and the money is never to be seen again,"" said Perez.IBTimes UK has contacted both Visa and Mastercard to ask if such a theft is possible and will update this story when we get a reply. Visa's press office says it is requesting a comment.Personal data theft from contactless cardsIt was reported by a Which? investigation back in July 2015 that contactless bank cards can be used to steal some of the owner's personal information - enough, in some cases, to make payments online with their card details. In one instance, a researcher with permission lifted the card holder's details from their card and used them to order a £3,000 television.""By touching volunteers' cards to our card reader, we got enough details to allow us to go on an internet shopping spree,"" a Which? spokesman said. ""With these card details, the contactless transaction limit is irrelevant, because online transactions aren't contactless.""At the time, the UK Cards Association said: ""The method shown by Which? is not a new discovery. Instances of fraud on contactless cards are in fact extremely rare, with losses of less than a penny for every £100 spent on contactless - far lower even than overall card fraud.""In this case, the cardholder's name and CCV code on the back of the card were not stolen, but Which? found a ""large online shop"" which allowed orders to be placed without asking for either.";Contactless Payment;http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/virtual-pickpockets-steal-money-contactless-bank-cards-by-bumping-into-victims-claims-londoner-1525211

579;Rail operator c2c launches new contactless payment system for cheaper travelPASSENGERS should be able to get access to cheaper rail travel with the launch of contactless payment wristbands. Train operator c2c is offering thousands of local rail passengers ëbPay by Barclaycardí contactless payment wristbands, which enable them to access cheaper rail travel. The firm, which runs services between Shoeburyness and Fenchurch Street in London, is offering the bPay wristbands, which contain a small contactless chip that allows them to make ëtouch and goí payments in the same way as a contactless credit or debit card to 8,000 selected local rail passengers in East London and Thurrock . These selected passengers all currently buy either weekly Travelcards or point-to-point season tickets within the Oyster pay-as-you-go area. They could save money by using bPay instead because they become eligible for the lower daily and weekly capping that applies to contactless travel payment. This would save those making the longest journeys up to £80 a month compared to the cost of their current tickets. bPay consists of a digital wallet to which users add funds from a UK-registered Visa or MasterCard debit or credit card, either ëon the goí using the mobile app, online, or set their account to do so automatically when their balance falls below a pre-set level. Like any other form of contactless payment, bPay can also be used to pay for transactions of £30 and under in over 300,000 locations across the UK. c2c managing director Julian Drury said: ìWeíre teaming up with bPay to help local rail passengers save money. If they register for one of these free wristbands, they can benefit from cheaper travel, plus make fast, easy and secure payments at thousands of retailers, every day. ìThis is part of our plans to improve the service that c2c passengers receive by providing them with better value, increasing capacity and delivering better customer service.î Current c2c passengers who would benefit from switching are being emailed directly with a unique code to register for their free bPay wristband. Contactless payment is currently available on c2c anywhere within the London travelcard zones and at Chafford Hundred, Ockendon, Purfleet and Grays, as well as on TfL services and other rail operators in London.

581;"Kerv, the World's First Contactless Payment Ring, Hits Kickstarter Funding Goal 2 Weeks EarlyKerv, the London fintech startup, reaches its £77k funding goal on crowd-funding site, Kickstarter, with two weeks of its month-long campaign remaining. Kerv wearers can make instant contactless payments of £30 or lower with a single gesture - no card, PIN, or paired smartphone required. Accepted anywhere in the world that takes contactless payments, Kerv is always on hand, removing the need to carry a wallet, purse, cash or cards - perfect for those with active lifestyles. The Kerv ring never needs charging and doesn't need to be paired with a smartphone to work.Kerv seamlessly blends form with function, creating a beautiful and understated piece of wearable tech which, uniquely, looks and feels nothing like a piece of wearable tech. Available in black or white, Kerv's sleek outer shell is engineered from zirconia ceramic, a material most often found in nuclear reactors and spacecraft. Zirconia is lightweight, hypoallergenic and one of the most scratch-resistant materials on the planet, necessary for an item of functional jewellery designed to be worn all day, every day. Kerv is also waterproof.Beyond retail payments, Kerv can be used on the Transport for London network (and other global cities' mass transit systems). Kerv also offers instant sharing of emergency, medical or contact details at the tap of an NFC-enabled phone, plus one-touch access via compatible NFC locks and security systems - which means even more pocket junk can be left at home.""This is a key moment for us, because it gives us the confidence that we have a product that can stand up against the big players in the financial industry, who have so far only been dipping their toes into wearable contactless payments solutions,"" says Kerv founder, Philip Campbell. ""We're ready to jump in with a splash.""Campbell continues: ""Hitting our funding target with another two weeks still to go is an amazing position to be in. We've proved that there's a demand for a contactless payment ring, and that our backers like the way we're tackling it - plus it gives us the capital we need to move forward. Over the next two weeks we hope to raise even further funding on Kickstarter, so that we can introduce six additional inner-band colours - along with the current black and white exteriors - to make Kerv rings even more special and personal.""Kerv Chairman David Hunter adds: ""The response we've had to our Kickstarter campaign has been overwhelming, with our backers offering some extremely useful insights and suggestions along the way. Having such direct communication with our inaugural customer base has been invaluable, and we hope to maintain that open dialogue as a key pillar of our brand and business.""Describing the origins of Kerv, Campbell said, ""Currently, wearable payment devices are either eye-wateringly expensive or thoroughly unattractive. But the biggest issue I have is that they're all worn on the wrist, which has to be placed flat against the contactless reader in a way that feels extremely unnatural and awkward. With a creative background - plus eight years' experience in payments - I felt we could do better. So we did, designing Kerv to be the most ergonomic, natural and convenient contactless payment method possible.""Kerv, the world's first contactless payment ring, launched its crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter on Friday September 25th, successfully reached its £77k funding goal on October 12th and will be finishing at 11pm BST on Monday October 26th.";Contactless Payment;http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/kerv-the-worlds-first-contactless-payment-ring-hits-kickstarter-funding-goal-2-weeks-early-532607711.html

That number was approaching nearly a quarter of purchases on Visa cards in June 2015.At MasterCard, which has been quicker to roll out tap-enabled cards, 27 per cent of in-store purchases were contactless as of September, a spokesperson said.More creditTap payments are designed for making small purchases more convenient, and are capped at $100, Visa says.But if shoppers arenít careful, many small purchases can add a lot more debt to a monthly credit card statement.A 2012 study commissioned by MasterCard found that cardholders that received tap-enabled cards spent almost 30 per cent more than previously.The study divided accounts into low-, medium- and high-spending segments based on their monthly spending habits prior to adoption.ìThe lift was consistent across the three segments, regardless of their spend levels prior to adoption,î the study said.MORE: Whatís fuelling Canadaís climb out of recession?

Samsung Pay looks set to have the upper hand as a US mobile payment startup has developed a way to use Samsung Pay for phone-to-phone payments.Currently, all offline mobile payment solutions require a Value Added Network (VAN) due to direct communication with the payment company. However, the new module from Hankook NFC will bypass the need for a VAN and means retailers no longer need specialist hardware and service plans to payments: instead, a Samsung smartphone with Samsung Pay and the Hankook module installed will suffice to accept payments.An official from Hankook NFC said:If Samsung Electronics expands the application of the NFC payment module, smartphones with Samsung Pay can be used as mobile payment devices. Accordingly, it is possible to not only transfer money between smartphones but also pay with credit cards.The module will also allow users to transfer money between phones and pay with a credit card, which could be perfect for small retailers, such as shops that take infrequent card payments. It would also present a great opportunity for temporary businesses such as stalls, which are quick to set up but donít readily accept card payments thanks to the lengthy VAN process involved.Thereís no doubt that the mobile payment industry is definitely one thatís set to grow and with Hankook NFC and Samsung in talks to utilise the new module, we may be witnessing the birth of the next generation of offline payments.;Contactless Payment;http://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-pay-may-soon-support-phone-to-phone-payments-654143/

But it is the developments in payments systems in supposedly less developed nations in Africa and Asia that point the way to the probable future for wider mobile banking.More than $30m in transactions were made in the first month in South Korea with Samsung Pay alone. Thomas Ko, vice-president of Samsung Pay, says ""not enough [had] been done to date to offer a viable alternative to the wallet"". Samsung's ""wallet"" lets the owners of its phones make contactless payments at the point of purchase, as well as online payments.But while Samsung and Apple will undoubtedly help the use of mobile payments to spread, the reality remains that the mobile phone as a means of payment remains relatively niche even in developed markets.In the UK, for example, just 1 per cent of people use their phones to make payments on a daily basis, according to Deloitte, even if more are beginning to sporadically test services as big retailers adopt contactless payment systems.Mobile payment schemes mostly copy the basic payment premise of debit and credit cards, as well as the walletsthat many people still carry. This makes them a high-tech alternative rather than an obvious upgrade for some people, even if mobile payments usually offer better user identification and authentication than cash or cards.But analysts anticipate a further shift as more financial services and greater interactivity are added, which is when mobile payments will become mobile banking. Countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, where traditional banking systems are less well entrenched, already point the way.Mobile users in developing nations do not necessarily want to use their phones just to pay for food at the supermarket as, sometimes, they do not. even have a bank account. Instead, the mobile phone is taking on extra roles as a place to keep money safe and move it around, as well as to acquire other financial services from trusted providers.Mobile wallets in developing nations have become a means of providing a stored value account through which to receive a payment on a mobile device and turn it into cash through an agent.According to Juniper Research, mobile devices have enabled people in ""highly underbanked markets to achieve first-time financial inclusivity"" and it found that more than 15 countries had more mobile money accounts than bank accounts atthe end of 2014.Many of the mobile payments services in Africa remain forms of money transfer and airtime top-up systems pioneered by schemes such asVodafone's M-Pesa, where people can move money and pay for goods.But services are quickly expanding to include loan disbursement, bill payment and micro insurance. Juniper cites India as a case in point. The most popular wallet is Paytm, but new entrants have been granted approval to provide a wider range of products such as acceptance of deposits and fund remittances.Mobile phones are also expected to take on extra financial functions in the future in western markets.Paula Felstead, chief officer for business strategy and direction at Visa Europe, says that the first wave of mobile banking apps has been focused on pure banking - the moving of payments from, to and between accounts.But, she adds, consumer behaviour and technology advances could well change this with new ways to move money between people that is driven by mobile access. ""That means a far broader sense of the term `mobile banking' becoming commonplace - and therefore an evolution of what mobile banking apps need to be able to do.""Stephen Ley, financial services partner and payments specialist at Deloitte, says that mobile banking apps have already overtaken branch and online interactions with customers, even if much activity is justbalance checking.""In the next few years mobile banking apps will become the predominant means to access all routine banking services, from applying for a loan or`Even in this digital age, people continue to trust their banks the mostfor their financial needs'overdraft increase to letting the bank know you are moving house,"" he adds.Banks need to lead the change in consumer behaviour, according to industry executives, given their trusted status and the strict licenses needed to extend into other financial services.""Consumers are being surrounded>Jy new payment choices every day but even in this digital age they continue to trust their banks the most for their financial needs,"" says Mark Barnett, president of MasterCard UK and Ireland.He adds: ""So while we are working closely with digital giants such as Apple, Samsung and Google to roll out their payment services, we're also working with the banks to create their own payment functionality embedded within their existing hugely popular banking apps""But Julien Duvaud-Schelnast, manager at Arthur D. Little, a US-based consultancy, says mobile banking is still in its infancy.He expects the market to expand into new areas such as direct debit payments, and he adds that more than half of smartphone users in the US used mobile banking services in 2014. So far, however, he says mobile is mostly acting as a complementary channel for basic activities, such as balance checks, rather then providing the main route of access to banking activities.In terms of providing access to a full range of banking services, it seems that mobile still has a long way to go.Hold the phone: many of the mobile payment functions used across Africa are stili basic forms of money transfer and telephone can top-up services";Contactless Payment;Finacial Times 14 ottobre 2015

However, in targeting that specific sector, the brand ended up unearthing another valuable target audience: connected moms.This group of mobile-savvy women is extremely connected to their devices as well as the community which they have built up. If these users stumble across a great mobile coupon or a giveaway, they are extremely likely to share it with each other in the hopes of saving some money.Consequently, brands with valuable deals may see these promotions go viral on social media. In the case of Pizza Hut, Visa Checkout awarded customers with one free, one-topping large pizza if they paid for a meal via its mobile or online platform.Visa saw fantastic success with this campaign, mostly due to the connected moms.The company will likely keep these results in mind when rolling out its holiday marketing campaigns with a slew of existing and new brand partners.""We wanted to coincide our marketing efforts with the very times there was an organic spike in ecommerce and mcommerce,"" Mr. Curtin said. ""We have one of the most comprehensive marketing communications pushes in payments right now in what we've got for the fall and holiday season.""Pushing boundariesVisa has also been branching out into new sectors this year, as evidenced by its decision to bring mobile payment options to the pump. It recently teamed up with Chevron to bring Visa Checkout to select branded gas stations in California this fall, a collaboration that was marked by a video spot featuring United States soccer star Carli Lloyd (see story).When paying at a Chevron station, consumers can hop out of their car, view the instructional clip and complete the transaction with their smartphone. Visa's commercial was also uploaded onto YouTube.""The quality of the [Carli Lloyd] spot I think is really strong,"" Mr. Curtin said. ""It is cool that Chevron and others are sitting back and saying that consumers may want to pay at the pump via mobile.""To me, it's creative strategic thinking. At the moment it's creating a market that does not necessarily exist.""Brands should be aiming to think outside the box when it comes to reaching potentially lucrative new segments.However, one thing is certain: mobile payments have cemented their status in commerce, and marketers who have not caught up to this phenomenon will be at a severe disadvantage with consumers, as early as this holiday season.""We're a category leader in payments,"" Mr. Curtin said. ""The category itself is in explosive intellectual and capital growth.""Every day you wake up and something new is happening in the space. In the future, there could be four or five incarnations of Visa on you at all times ? whether a card in your wallet or in the watch on your wrist or on the mobile phone in your hand.""";Contactless Payment;Mobile Commerce Daily - Payments
591;"MasterCard joins forces to speed up smart transit projectsANDREW EDGECLIFFE-JOHNSON - NEW YORKMasterCard is building a network of partnerships to realise the potential of contactless and mobile payments to make urban transit systems work more efficiently, as ""smart cities"" offer a means of expanding the market for its cards.In tests from Philadelphia to Gujarat, MasterCard has begun to integrate payment systems for train, metro, bus and road toll systems.""Eighty five per cent of the world's payments are still in cash. To me that's our largest opportunity,"" Ajay Banga, MasterCard's chief executive, told the Financial Times.MasterCard analysis found that transit systems - along with coffee and newspapers - were one of the largest markets in which cash dominates payment cards. ""It's $200bn a year in different cities around the world, which has the opportunity to be transformative for ourbusiness,"" Mr Banga said.The company announced a partnership in March with Cubic Transportation Systems, which uses traffic data to advise network operators from London to Chicago whether they need to change routes or pricing to cope with rush hour demand, and to alert commuters by smartphone of the best options.Other new partners include Masabi, which allows users to buy tickets using their mobiles, and Parkeon, a parking company with which MasterCard this week announced a plan to turn parking meters into kiosks that offer coupons for local businesses.`It's $200bn a year,which has the opportunity to be transformativefor our business'Mr Banga said MasterCard's aim in cities such as Philadelphia was to cut the time that train passengers spent buying a separate bus ticket, and ""intelligent personal routing"", using data to advise users of their best routes home. A pilot programme in the city is due to expand into a full consumer launch this year.""All transit systems are built for the peak of the peak. If you could find a way to take 5-7 per cent of the peak of the peak traffic off to less-used routes you could reduce the cost of how you build and plan transit systems enormously,"" he said, estimating that large urban transit. systems could save $150m-$200m by being able to delay upgrades to their infrastructure.Citing the example of Transport for London, which has opened up its ticketing systems from depending on its Oyster Card contactless payment system to accepting ordinary bank cards, Mr Banga said MasterCard could save transit system operators the cost of maintaining their own systems.""It's actually cheaper for them"" than maintaining their own systems and handling cash, he said. ""It takes out. the friction:"" Mr Banga said that getting transit systems to accept payment cards could be a ""critical factor"" in expanding MasterCard's market. It processed more than 11bn transactions in the first quarter from the 2.2bn MasterCard and Maestro cards in issue.Mr Banga added that most MasterCard users were in cities, which are home to more than half of the world's population and about half of the world's ""financially excluded"" - a group MasterCard has been targeting through separate initiatives with the UN, the World Bank and others.The company is among several, including IBM and Google, to have identified the business potential in the rise of ""smart cities"" - increasingly automated and connected urban areas whose authorities use datato inform the provision of public services.More public-private partnerships would be needed as urbanisation puts a strain on city networks, Mr Banga added, saying the challenges that transit systems face were ""too vast, too deep"" to tackle alone.MasterCard has identified potential in the rise of `smart cities'";Contactless Payment;FINANCIAL TIMES 03-07-2015
592;"Europeís top-down plan to reduce credit card fraud using smart cards achieved its goal. But the U.S.ís more spontaneous bottom-up approach will achieve much more. Once again we hear that the U.S. lags Europe in an important new technology. The U.S. is just now moving away from plain magnetic stripe credit cards, which are vulnerable to counterfeiting, while Europe and Asia switched to more secure chip-based ìsmart cardsî years ago. Thereís no disputing that Europe and Asia are the smart card leaders, but the U.S. is poised to leap ahead with smartphone-based mobile payments. And itís worth understanding why. Europe is sometimes first-to-market with new technologies, because Europe chooses relatively safe new technologies and carefully manages their implementation. The U.S. produces more innovation, however, because there is more spontaneous, bottom-up development in the U.S. For starters, the U.S. is positioned to take the lead in mobile payments for logistical reasons. Europe and Asia have already invested heavily in upgrading their point of sale (POS) terminals to accept smart cards. The U.S. is just starting to replace magnetic stripe cards with smart cards, and manufacturers have decided to offer future-proof card readers that support both smart card and smartphone payments. While the incentives for U.S. merchants to upgrade to the new dual-purpose card readers are compelling, it will be much harder to persuade merchants in Europe and Asia to swap out generally newer terminals that already accept smart cards. The original incentive for merchants to upgrade to payment terminals that support the EMV (Europay, MasterCard, and Visa) smart card standard was liability. Liability for certain types of ìcard presentî transactions are shifting from the card issuers to merchants who have not upgraded to accept smart cards. (You can learn more about the migration to smart cards in the U.S. by visiting the Smart Card Alliance website.) However, U.S. merchants now have even greater incentive to upgrade to new dual-purpose card readers: the readersí ability to accept smartphone-based mobile payments. Security-wise, smartphones can do everything smart cards can do and more. Smartphone users increasingly demand self-service options for accessing product information, receiving notifications and special offers and paying. And brick-and-mortar merchants have discovered that they can deliver superior shopping experiences to smartphone users through personalization and contextual engagement. Here are some options for mobile payments. NFCOnly a choice of solutions can ensure the success of mobile payments. One of the most compelling is built around near field communication (NFC), the technology that enables smartphones to make ìtap and goî payments on dual-purpose card readers, and that is rapidly becoming a standard smartphone feature. (A list of NFC-capable smartphones and tablets can be found here.) An NFC smartphone emulates a ìcontactlessî EMV card. (Most EMV smart cards are the ìcontactî variety and must be inserted in the new readers; however, there are also ìcontactlessî cards that the user merely taps against the reader.) NFC adds a unique layer of physical security: Communication between the reader and the phone is limited to within just a few centimeters. Thatís because in mobile payment applications only one of the NFC devices generates a signal -- the other device merely adds information to the signal that can only be recovered at very close range. There are other cool applications for NFC, such as reading inexpensive tags that can be attached to retail shelves, displays, and even individual items. The NFC Forum has done yeomanís work developing NFC specifications and promoting the technologyís use, and provides resources for developers. P97 NetworksP97 Networks has developed a cloud-based mobile payment solution called PetroZone for convenience and fuel retail stores. There are roughly 150,000 gas stations with 1.3 million gas dispensers in the U.S., generating 41 million transactions daily, accounting for about 16% of all credit card activity. Replacing the readers at gas pumps will be expensive and time-consuming, so another solution is urgently needed. PetroZone requires no new hardware at the pump and tackles the security issue using multi-factor authentication: something the user has (the phone), something the user knows (a passcode), and something the user is (the userís current location as determined by GPS). According to P97 Networks, PetroZone mobile payments are more secure than traditional credit card payments, and enable alternative payment modes such as automatic clearing house (ACH). emv chip and pinemv cardtap paypalmobile paymentsP97 mobile payment at pumpP97 Networks  Monica Danna (CC: BY)  More exciting and forward-looking are PetroZoneís behavioral marketing capabilities. For instance, users with automobiles featuring ìconnected carî technology can be automatically notified when their fuel tank is low and directed to a nearby gas station with the best price or a special offer for something the user has purchased in the past. The user saves money while the merchant drives revenue -- perhaps while steering the user to the most cost-effective payment mode. LoopayInnovation sometimes means breathing new life into old technology. LoopPay, acquired by Samsung in early 2015, enables mobile payments using legacy card readers. The firmís magnetic secure transmission (MST) technology allows smartphones to emulate swiping a magnetic stripe card through a magnetic stripe card reader. The user pays by holding the device (either an iPhone with a special LoopPay case or the device that slides out of the case) next to the reader and either tapping the pay button in the LoopPay app or pushing the button on the LoopPay device. LoopPay users can start making mobile payments nearly everywhere, right now. LoopPayís solution may be disconcerting when first encountered, however. The check-out clerk may be worried when they see the user paying by holding an electronic gadget near the card reader rather than swiping a card. Plus, the LoopPay CardCase includes a storage area for the userís ID and a backup credit card. A place is needed to store the userís ID because mobile payment users could make leaving their wallets at home a habit. The backup credit card is no doubt in case a merchant refuses to accept payment using an unfamiliar device. In summaryThere are now mobile payment solutions in the U.S. for new card readers, for bypassing card readers, and for old card readers. Each can do things that smart cards canít. Europeís plan to reduce credit card fraud in stores by using smart cards achieved its goal. The U.S.ís more flexible and spontaneous approach will achieve much more. Mobile payments will be an important tool for digital businesses, enabling them to deliver more choices, personalization, and engagement.  Out of the simple act of paying, entrepreneurs will invent new and often unexpected forms of value. Not everything can be planned years in advance.

593;"Kerv Smart Ring Forged by Contactless Payment InnovatorIf your wallet weighs you down, you might want to try a smart ring.That is the view of Philip Campbell, founder of London-based startup Kerv, whose firm has produced a smooth, shiny piece of wearable tech that aims to tap into the growing market for contactless payments.The Kerv ring uses Near Field Communication (NFC) to let users make payments of up to £30 ($46) by simply waving your hand at shop checkouts and public transport barriers, much like contactless credit or debit cards. It doesn't need charging nor does it need to be paired with a smartphone. Kerv is not the only wearable device with payment functionality ñ NFC-enabled smartwatches like Apple Watch and wristbands like Barclaycard's BPay also let you pay for goods ñ but it is the first payment ring. Campbell sees flaws in rival payment devices, though, describing them in a statement as either ìeye-wateringly expensiveî or ìthoroughly unattractive.îBorn Out of FrustrationCampbell began building the Kerv ring while running a marketing agency that serves the payments industry. ìWe were being asked to promote payment products where the user was seen as not very important or the technology wasnít there,"" he says. ""We just got frustrated and decided to do it better ourselves.î The project is seeking funding through crowdfunding site Kickstarter, raising more than half of its £77,000 target within five days at the time of writing.Ë square before the information Source: Kerv The idea was spurred by the fact that most of Europe will accept contactless payments by 2020, as Visa and Mastercard mandate retailers to upgrade their point-of-sale terminals. The U.S. lags behind with payments technology, only just launching chip and pin this year.""The ability to pay for public transport is the application most likely to drive adoption,"" Saverio Romeo, a wearable technology analyst at Beecham Research, says of Kerv. He adds that the upper price limit for contactless payments will limit its use ñ as will the reliance on contactless infrastructure, currently concentrated in cities. Style vs. FunctionUsers need to set up an account with Kerv to use it as a digital wallet ñ much like pre-pay credit cards or London's Oyster travel card system. Linking Kerv to another bank account allows for automatic top-ups. Kerv takes a small fee with each transaction, paid by the merchant ó and it's accepted wherever MasterCard is.Looks-wise, the accessory is simple and sleek, made from the same material used to craft ceramic dental crowns. The material was chosen because it doesnít interfere with the small electromagnetic field that powers the contactless functionality; itís also waterproof, hypo-allergenic, scratch-resistant, and comes in a range of sizes. On the face of it, Kerv looks similar to NFC Ring, a product that launched in 2013. However, the latter focuses on unlocking doors and mobile phones ñ something Kerv can also do ñ instead of payments.A more direct competitor is Barclaycard's BPay wristband, which is linked to a proper licensed bank that customers know and trust - but is hampered (in Campbell's view) by ugly design. Barclaycard says it's ""constantly refining and improving"" the band based on customer feedback. ""People told us that style and design are key, so we made some big changes to the latest generation to make it more stylish and comfortable, which has had a really positive response,î said a spokesman.Streamlined Digital WalletWhile the ring is Kerv's flagship launch product, Campbell says Kerv is proposing much more than a single device. ìWeíre trying to design a digital wallet with a much smoother user experience and then connect that to multiple hardware devices,î he says.Users of the Kerv service will get an account number and sort code, just like at a regular bank account, and theyíll be able to request a contactless card should they want one.Kerv is categorized as an electronic money-issuer rather than a bank, and intends to then tackle friction points in the consumer experience of banking. One use could be to set up prepaid accounts so teenage children can learn how to manage money. Currency cards, which offer better exchange rates for spending money abroad, but which donít work so well back home, are another target.ìThere ought to be a way you have a product you can use at home and abroad and not be penalized for doing so,î Campbell says.";Contactless Payment;http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-02/kerv-smart-ring-the-contactless-payment-wearable
594;The ABCs Of HCEMobile devices that act as payments cards, room keys, transit cards, event passes and building access badges ñ these are all things that HCE can make possible, safely and securely. Yet, a number of misperceptions about HCE exist in regard to whether itís secure, whether the merchant needs to buy new POS equipment, and whether it will support gift and private label cards.SimplyTapp looks to address the myths surrounding host card emulation (HCE) technology in its latest white paper, ìThe ABCs of HCE.î According to SimplyTapp, HCE bridges the gap between a card issuer and its customers by enabling mobile payments both in-app and at the point-of-sale.By eliminating the need for banks to prepare smartphones for mobile payments by downloading payment card information into the Secure Element of the phone, HCE allows for the development of mobile apps that actually act as smart cards for secure tap-and-go payments and other real-world transactions.Allowing mobile devices to serve as proxies for payment cards, transit cards, event passes or even room keys makes HCE a practical solution, but there are those that still see it and other cloud-based payment solutions as less safe than passing sensitive data through a deviceís Secure Element, or the tamper-resistant platform that can host applications and sensitive data.But as SimplyTappís white paper states, HCE actually maintains a direct integration within a bankís secure cloud environment and transaction flow, providing the ability to offer device biometrics, issuance of limited use keys, provisioning of transaction tokens, and support for real-time threat assessment.Another common misunderstanding when it comes to the use of HCE technology is that enabling it will require merchants to purchase new equipment at the POS.Today, many POS terminals already have the ability to accept contactless payments, and because HCE allows an Android phoneís NFC controller to work exactly as a contactless card would, there often is no need for new POS equipment when enabling HCE-based mobile payments.While there are many implications for HCE-based mobile payments in retail, the use cases for its approach to contactless real-world transactions span across a variety of industries, including transit, ticketing and hospitality.Not only can HCE support gift cards and private-label cards for retailers, but it can also provide travelers and commuters with an improved consumer experience through the ability to move transit cards to smartphones for mobile, contactless payments, and even the ability to upgrade seats or pay for checked luggage all from their mobile devices, SimplyTapp said.In some ways, HCE may seem too good to be true or too complicated to implement, but, as SimplyTapp explained, HCE is designed to take the burden away from card networks by giving card issuers and merchants more flexibility.From utilizing tokenization, to safeguarding customer data via secure tokens, to offering merchants the same lower interchange fees as they would have for card-present transactions, HCE aims to make mobile payments more accessible for card issuers while ensuring a customizable and contactless experience for users.As the mobile payments market continues to grow, fueled by factors such as the proliferation of NFC-enabled devices and new opportunities presented through cloud-based payments, SimplyTapp considers HCE to be a ìtunnelî through which banking apps can more easily leverage the NFC connection between mobile devices and the merchantís POS.HCE has the potential to play a significant role in the predicted growth spurt mobile payment usage could see over the coming years by eliminating the liability of data protection and the operational risks many mobile carriers and retailers currently face, leaving the responsibility of issuing and securing credentials to the domain of the financial institutions;Contactless Payment;http://www.pymnts.com/news/2015/the-abcs-of-hce/
